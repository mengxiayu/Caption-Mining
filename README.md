# Obdisian-Concept-Map

# To open a concept map using Obsidian

First, download Obdisian. https://obsidian.md/

Second, open folder as vault.

Then, open and customize graph viiew.

# To create a link in Obsidian

Let's say there is a file named "CS_410.md" and another file named "text retrieval.md". The way to create a link between them is to write "[[text retrieval]]" in CS_410.md or to write "[[CS_410]]" in another file. These two ways should create links with different direction.

Note that file names should end with ".md".


# Example

An example is in week07/course_concepts/. If you set it as a vault in Obsidian, you should be able to visualize the links with "graph view".
