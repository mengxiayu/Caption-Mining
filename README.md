# To create a link in Obsidian
Let's say there is a file named "CS_410.md" and another file named "text retrieval.md". The way to create a link between them is to write "[[text retrieval]]" in CS_410.md or to write "[[CS_410]]" in another file. These two ways should create links with different direction.

Note that file names should end with ".md".
