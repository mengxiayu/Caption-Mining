1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772827	60	00:02:26.46	00:02:27.646666	coverage for each document.

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772828	63	00:02:34.17	00:02:34.95	what extent.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772829	64	00:02:34.95	00:02:37.69	So we hope to generate these as output
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772829	65	00:02:37.69	00:02:39.54	because there are many useful
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772829	66	00:02:39.54	00:02:41.47	applications if we can do that.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.77283	67	00:02:42.79	00:02:46.46	So the idea of PSA is actually very
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-12-05 05:00:10.269301	67	00:02:42.79	00:02:46.46	So the idea of PLSA is actually very
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.77283	68	00:02:46.46	00:02:48.32	similar to the two component mixture
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772831	69	00:02:48.32	00:02:50.125	model that we have already introduced.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772831	70	00:02:50.125	00:02:52.663333	The only difference is that we're going
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772832	71	00:02:52.663333	00:02:54.24	to have more than two topics.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772832	72	00:02:54.24	00:02:56.79	Otherwise it's essentially the same.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772833	73	00:02:57.59	00:02:59.35	So here I illustrate how we can
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772833	74	00:02:59.35	00:03:00.97	generate the text that I was multiple
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772834	75	00:03:00.97	00:03:01.54	topics.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772834	76	00:03:02.6	00:03:07.05	And naturally, in all cases of
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772834	77	00:03:07.05	00:03:09.44	probabilistic modeling, would want to
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772835	78	00:03:09.44	00:03:11.32	figure out the likelihood function.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772835	79	00:03:11.32	00:03:13.43	So we will also ask the question what's
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772836	80	00:03:13.43	00:03:16.11	the probability of observing a world W
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772836	81	00:03:16.11	00:03:17.38	from such a mixture model?
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772837	82	00:03:18.08	00:03:19.45	Now if you look at this picture and
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772837	83	00:03:19.45	00:03:21.082	compare this with the picture that you
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772838	84	00:03:21.082	00:03:22.94	have seen earlier, you will see the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772838	85	00:03:22.94	00:03:24.63	only difference is that we have added
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772839	86	00:03:24.63	00:03:25.74	more topics here.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772839	87	00:03:26.76	00:03:30.12	So before we have just one topic
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.77284	88	00:03:30.12	00:03:33.62	besides the background topical, but now
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772841	89	00:03:33.62	00:03:35.91	we have more topics.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772841	90	00:03:35.91	00:03:37.685	Specifically we have K topics.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772842	91	00:03:37.685	00:03:41.52	Now all these are topics that we assume
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772842	92	00:03:41.52	00:03:44.259999	that exist in the text data, so the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772842	93	00:03:44.26	00:03:46.41	consequences that our switch for
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772843	94	00:03:46.41	00:03:48.656	choosing a topic now is multiway switch
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772843	95	00:03:48.656	00:03:51.16	before it's just a two way switch.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772844	96	00:03:51.16	00:03:53.02	Going to think of as flipping a coin.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772844	97	00:03:53.02	00:03:54.91	But now we have multiple is.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772844	98	00:03:54.91	00:03:57.83	First we can flip a coin to decide
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772845	99	00:03:57.83	00:03:59.361666	whether we will talk about the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772845	100	00:03:59.361666	00:03:59.733333	background.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772845	101	00:03:59.733333	00:04:01.219999	So it's the background.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772846	102	00:04:01.43	00:04:05.25	Lambda sub B versus non background.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772846	103	00:04:05.25	00:04:08.54	So this one minus Lambda B gives us the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772846	104	00:04:08.54	00:04:11.27	probability of actually choosing a

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772847	106	00:04:13.94	00:04:14.95	And background help.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772848	107	00:04:15.68	00:04:17.86	After we have made this decision, we
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772848	108	00:04:17.86	00:04:20.71	have to make another decision to choose
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772849	109	00:04:20.71	00:04:23.92	one of these K distributions.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772849	110	00:04:24.65	00:04:25.87	So there's a key way.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.77285	111	00:04:25.87	00:04:28.12	Switch here, and this is characterized
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.77285	112	00:04:28.12	00:04:30.32	by the pies, and there's someone.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772851	113	00:04:31.33	00:04:33.365	So this is just the different designs
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-12-05 05:42:59.272379	113	00:04:31.33	00:04:33.365	So this is just the different design
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772851	114	00:04:33.365	00:04:34.75	of switches, a little bit more
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772851	115	00:04:34.75	00:04:37.84	complicated, but once we decide which
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772851	116	00:04:37.84	00:04:39.91	distribution to use, the rest is the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772852	117	00:04:39.91	00:04:40.22	same.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772852	118	00:04:40.22	00:04:42.27	We're going to generate the world by
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772852	119	00:04:42.27	00:04:44.54	using one of these distributions,
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772853	120	00:04:44.54	00:04:45.28	assume here.

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772854	122	00:04:48.71	00:04:50.625	about the like hold.

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772854	124	00:04:53.5	00:04:55.4	a word from such a distribution?

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772855	126	00:04:57.12	00:04:59.78	Now we've seen this problem many Times
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772856	127	00:04:59.78	00:05:04.43	Now, and if you recall, it's generally
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772856	128	00:05:04.43	00:05:06.21	a sum over all the different

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772858	131	00:05:11.46	00:05:13.7	world can be generated from the

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772893	209	00:08:00.37	00:08:02.07	Those are the most important parameters
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772893	210	00:08:02.07	00:08:06.35	that we are asked, so one is pies and
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772893	211	00:08:06.35	00:08:09.79	these are the coverage of topic in the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772894	212	00:08:09.79	00:08:10.46	document.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772894	213	00:08:11.16	00:08:13.61	And the other is the word distributions
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772895	214	00:08:13.61	00:08:15.41	that characterize all the topics.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772895	215	00:08:17.93	00:08:22.94	So the next line then is simply to plug
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772896	216	00:08:22.94	00:08:25.829999	this in to calculate the probability of
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772896	217	00:08:25.829999	00:08:26.103333	document.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772896	218	00:08:26.103333	00:08:28.31	This is again of the familiar form
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772897	219	00:08:28.31	00:08:29.94	where you have some and you have
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772897	220	00:08:29.94	00:08:32.18	account of world in the document and
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772897	221	00:08:32.18	00:08:34.685	then log of a probability.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772898	222	00:08:34.685	00:08:37.76	Now it's a little bit more complicated
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772898	223	00:08:37.76	00:08:39.63	than the two component because now we
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772899	224	00:08:39.63	00:08:40.73	have more components.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772899	225	00:08:40.73	00:08:43.994	So the sum involves more terms and then
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.7729	226	00:08:43.994	00:08:46.39	this line is just the Holder for the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-12-05 06:58:52.692094	226	00:08:43.994	00:08:46.39	this line is just the like holder for the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.7729	227	00:08:46.39	00:08:48.91	whole collection and it's very similar.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.7729	228	00:08:49	00:08:50.69	Just accounting for more documents in
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772901	229	00:08:50.69	00:08:51.23	the collection.

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772901	231	00:08:54.1	00:08:56.06	I already said there are two kinds on
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772902	232	00:08:56.06	00:08:56.94	his coverage.

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772903	234	00:08:59.04	00:09:01.18	Again, it's a useful exercise for you
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772903	235	00:09:01.18	00:09:03.89	to figure out exactly how many premise

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772904	237	00:09:05.66	00:09:07.36	How many unknown parameters are there?
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772904	238	00:09:07.36	00:09:09.97	Now trying to figure out that question
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772905	239	00:09:09.97	00:09:11.96	would help you understand the model in

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772905	241	00:09:14.395	00:09:16.14	you to understand what would be the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772906	242	00:09:16.14	00:09:18.665	output that we generate when we use PSA

1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772907	244	00:09:20.91	00:09:22.609999	precisely the unknown parameters.
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772907	245	00:09:24.38	00:09:26.16	So after we have obtained the
1cc2d7fa-3d11-49fa-b979-ef5e9442466f	2020-11-02 22:56:18.772907	246	00:09:26.16	00:09:28.32	likelihood function shown here, the

20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613497	13	00:00:38.17	00:00:41.86	So here what you see is on the X
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613497	14	00:00:41.86	00:00:42.325	dimension.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613498	15	00:00:42.325	00:00:43.95	We have set up value.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613498	16	00:00:43.95	00:00:45.965	This is the parameter that we left on
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613498	17	00:00:45.965	00:00:46.8175	the Y axis.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613499	18	00:00:46.8175	00:00:48.83	We see the likelihood function.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613499	19	00:00:50.7	00:00:55.27	So this curve is reaching or like
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.6135	20	00:00:55.27	00:00:56.486666	roller function, right?
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613501	21	00:00:56.486666	00:00:57.41	So this one.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613501	22	00:00:58.04	00:01:00.492	And this is the one that we hope to
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613501	23	00:01:00.492	00:01:03.01	maximize an we hope to find a set of
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613502	24	00:01:03.01	00:01:05.7	value at this point to maximize this.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613502	25	00:01:06.55	00:01:08.41	But in the case of mixture model, we
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613503	26	00:01:08.41	00:01:10.84	cannot easily find the analytical
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613503	27	00:01:10.84	00:01:12.25	solution to the problem.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613504	28	00:01:12.25	00:01:13.95	So we have to resolve a numerical
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613504	29	00:01:13.95	00:01:14.24	algorithm.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613505	30	00:01:14.24	00:01:16.44	An EM algorithm is such an algorithm.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613505	31	00:01:16.44	00:01:18.19	It's a Hill climb algorithm that would
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613505	32	00:01:18.19	00:01:22.36	mean you start with some random guess.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613506	33	00:01:22.36	00:01:24.675	Let's say you start from here.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613506	34	00:01:24.675	00:01:26.64	That's your starting point and then you
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613507	35	00:01:26.64	00:01:32.009999	try to improve this by moving this to
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613507	36	00:01:32.01	00:01:34.19	another point where you can have a
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613507	37	00:01:34.19	00:01:35.27	higher like recorder.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613508	38	00:01:35.27	00:01:37.12	So that's the idea of Hill climbing.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613508	39	00:01:37.56	00:01:40.97	Any in the MRI was the way we achieve
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613508	40	00:01:40.97	00:01:42.98	this is to do two things.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613509	41	00:01:42.98	00:01:45.91	First will fix a lower bound of
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613509	42	00:01:45.91	00:01:47.943333	likelihood function, so this is the
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61351	43	00:01:47.943333	00:01:49.25	lower bound you can see here.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61351	44	00:01:51.15	00:01:54.43	An once we fit the lower bound we can
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61351	45	00:01:54.43	00:01:57.79	then maximise the lower bound and of
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613511	46	00:01:57.79	00:01:59.59	course the reason why this works is
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613512	47	00:01:59.59	00:02:01.595	because the lower bound is much easier
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613512	48	00:02:01.595	00:02:04.7525	to optimize so we know our current gas
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613512	49	00:02:04.7525	00:02:08.4525	is here an by maximizing the lower
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613513	50	00:02:08.4525	00:02:11.45	bound will move this point to the top
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613513	51	00:02:11.45	00:02:12.14	two here.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613513	52	00:02:13.12	00:02:13.73	I.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613514	53	00:02:14.54	00:02:16.43	And that we can then map to the
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613514	54	00:02:16.43	00:02:18.59	original like role function.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613515	55	00:02:18.59	00:02:19.49	We find this point.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613515	56	00:02:20.06	00:02:21.99	Be cause it's a lower bound, we are
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613515	57	00:02:21.99	00:02:24.62	guaranteed to improve this gas.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613516	58	00:02:25.26	00:02:27.21	Right, because we improve our lower
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613516	59	00:02:27.21	00:02:29.77	bound and then the original lighter
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613517	60	00:02:29.77	00:02:32.44	Holder curve which is above this lower
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613517	61	00:02:32.44	00:02:34.83	bound will definitely be improved as
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613517	62	00:02:34.83	00:02:35.28	well.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613518	63	00:02:35.87	00:02:38.14	I so we already know it's improving the
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613518	64	00:02:38.14	00:02:40.105	lower bound, so we definitely improve
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613519	65	00:02:40.105	00:02:42.19	this original like record function
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613519	66	00:02:42.19	00:02:45.689999	which is above this lower bound.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61352	67	00:02:47.42	00:02:51.436	So in our example, the current gas is
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61352	68	00:02:51.436	00:02:53.22	parameter value given by the current
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61352	69	00:02:53.22	00:02:55.465	generation and then the next guest is
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613521	70	00:02:55.465	00:02:57.54	the RE estimated parameter values.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613521	71	00:02:57.54	00:03:00.0325	From this illustration you can see the
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613521	72	00:03:00.0325	00:03:02.82	next gas is always better than the
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613522	73	00:03:02.82	00:03:04.86	current gas unless it has reached the
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613522	74	00:03:04.86	00:03:06.913333	maximum where it would be stuck there.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613523	75	00:03:06.913333	00:03:08.15	So the two would be equal.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613523	76	00:03:09.73	00:03:14.37	So the E step is basically to compute
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613523	77	00:03:14.37	00:03:16.38	this lower bound.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613524	78	00:03:17.5	00:03:19.43	And we don't direct it, just computed
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613524	79	00:03:19.43	00:03:21.79	this likely or function, but we
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613525	80	00:03:21.79	00:03:25.14	computed the latent variable values
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613525	81	00:03:25.14	00:03:26.01	and.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613525	82	00:03:26.01	00:03:28.635	These are basically part of this lower
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613526	83	00:03:28.635	00:03:28.9175	bound.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613526	84	00:03:28.9175	00:03:30.902	This helps determine the lower bound
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613526	85	00:03:30.902	00:03:32.76	the M step on the other hand, is to
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613527	86	00:03:32.76	00:03:34.2025	maximize the lower bound.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613527	87	00:03:34.2025	00:03:36.21	It allows us to move parameters to a
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613528	88	00:03:36.21	00:03:36.78	new point.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613528	89	00:03:37.37	00:03:39.88	And that's why EML is gone.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613528	90	00:03:39.88	00:03:41.64	The little converge to a local maximum.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613529	91	00:03:42.37	00:03:44.73	Now, as you can imagine, when we have
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613529	92	00:03:44.73	00:03:47.66	many local Maxima, we also have to
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613529	93	00:03:47.66	00:03:50.2	repeat the EML with multiple times in

20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61353	95	00:03:52.13	00:03:54.27	actual global maximum.

20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613531	97	00:03:56.09	00:03:58.42	difficult problem in numerical
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613531	98	00:03:58.42	00:03:58.98	optimization.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613532	99	00:03:58.98	00:04:01.46	So here for example, how do we start
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613532	100	00:04:01.46	00:04:02.77	from here?
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613532	101	00:04:02.77	00:04:06.03	Then we gradually just climb up to this
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613533	102	00:04:06.03	00:04:09.18	top, so that's not optimal, and we'd
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613533	103	00:04:09.18	00:04:11.193333	like to climb up all the way to here.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613533	104	00:04:11.193333	00:04:13.185714	So the only way to climb up to this
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613534	105	00:04:13.185714	00:04:13.409999	here.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613534	106	00:04:13.46	00:04:15.77	This will start from somewhere here or
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613534	107	00:04:15.77	00:04:16.17	here.

20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613535	109	00:04:19.63	00:04:22.176666	In the EM algorithm, we generally would
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613535	110	00:04:22.176666	00:04:24.01	have to start from different points or
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613536	111	00:04:24.01	00:04:26.26	have some other way to determine a good
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613536	112	00:04:26.26	00:04:28.1	initial starting point.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613536	113	00:04:29.13	00:04:30.94	To summarize, in this lecture we
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613537	114	00:04:30.94	00:04:32.99	introduce the EM algorithm.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613537	115	00:04:32.99	00:04:35.05	This is a general algorithm for
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613537	116	00:04:35.05	00:04:35.6	computing.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613538	117	00:04:35.6	00:04:37.98	Maximum regular is made of all kinds of
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613538	118	00:04:37.98	00:04:38.88	mixture models.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613538	119	00:04:38.88	00:04:41.1	So not just for our simple mixture
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613539	120	00:04:41.1	00:04:43.87	model and so here climbing algorithm so
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613539	121	00:04:43.87	00:04:45.565	can only converge it or local maximum,
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613539	122	00:04:45.565	00:04:47.74	and it would depend on initial points.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61354	123	00:04:49.67	00:04:52.45	The general idea is that we will have
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61354	124	00:04:52.45	00:04:54.81	two steps to improve the estimate of
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.61354	125	00:04:54.81	00:04:56.335	parameters in the E step.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613541	126	00:04:56.335	00:04:59.21	We roughly all augmenting our data by
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613541	127	00:04:59.21	00:05:00.97	predicting values of useful hidden
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613541	128	00:05:00.97	00:05:04.44	variables that we would use to simplify
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613542	129	00:05:04.44	00:05:05.15	the estimation.
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613542	130	00:05:05.15	00:05:08.42	In our case, this is the distribution
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613542	131	00:05:08.42	00:05:09.81	that has been used to generate the

20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613543	133	00:05:11.03	00:05:13.42	In the end step, then would exploit
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613544	134	00:05:13.42	00:05:15.66	such augmented data, which would make
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613544	135	00:05:15.66	00:05:18.06	it easier to estimate the distribution
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613544	136	00:05:18.06	00:05:20.679999	to improve the estimate of parameters.

20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613546	140	00:05:27.74	00:05:30.82	will have a stable converged parameter
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613546	141	00:05:30.82	00:05:32.795	values, even though the likelihood
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613546	142	00:05:32.795	00:05:34.93	function is insured to increase.

20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613548	147	00:05:47.37	00:05:49.66	Now he thought data augmentation is
20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613549	148	00:05:49.66	00:05:50.77	done probabilistically.

20703c3c-ced6-4410-ace1-139baa46505c	2020-11-02 23:10:04.613549	150	00:05:52.63	00:05:54.389999	exactly what's the value of a hidden

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241641	98	00:04:00.026	00:04:00.98	of a variable?

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241643	102	00:04:06.3	00:04:08.21	information theory to measure the

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241647	108	00:04:19.67	00:04:21.66	entropy function as a function defined.

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241647	110	00:04:23.3	00:04:25.23	In this case it's a binary random
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241648	111	00:04:25.23	00:04:26.98	variable, although the definition can
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241648	112	00:04:26.98	00:04:29.5175	be easily generalized for a random
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241649	113	00:04:29.5175	00:04:31.19	variable with multiple values.

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.24165	115	00:04:34.89	00:04:36.77	There's a sum over all the possible

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241654	125	00:04:59.76	00:05:01.63	and that can be mathematically prove.
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-24 07:04:19.44929	125	00:04:59.76	00:05:01.63	and that can be mathematically proved.

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241658	133	00:05:28.35	00:05:30.54	So this is the entropy function and
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241658	134	00:05:30.54	00:05:32.45	this function will give a different

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.24169	206	00:08:56.4975	00:08:58.8	the two cases, and if you plug in these
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.24169	207	00:08:58.8	00:09:01.29	values you can see the entropies.
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-24 07:12:43.957489	207	00:08:58.8	00:09:01.29	values you can see the entropies,

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241692	210	00:09:09.01	00:09:09.69	that's one.
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241692	211	00:09:11.12	00:09:13.91	For the completely biased coin we see
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241693	212	00:09:13.91	00:09:16.83	is 0 and that intuitively makes a lot

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241697	221	00:09:37.13	00:09:39.57	middle point, or it's very uncertain.

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241699	227	00:09:53.51	00:09:54.71	for water prediction.

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241701	229	00:09:56.7	00:09:58.68	problem right, still predicted weather

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241702	232	00:10:01.52	00:10:03.56	Again, think about the three words.
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241702	233	00:10:03.56	00:10:04.75	Particularly, think about their
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241703	234	00:10:04.75	00:10:05.55	interface.
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-24 07:14:55.00681	234	00:10:04.75	00:10:05.55	entropies.
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241703	235	00:10:06.41	00:10:09.08	Now we can assume high entropy words
2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241703	236	00:10:09.08	00:10:10.38	are harder to predict.

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241704	238	00:10:14.28	00:10:17.91	way to tell us which word is harder to

2736e0b3-cd3e-4760-b07e-e9aadcc588e2	2020-11-02 23:15:52.241705	241	00:10:22.44	00:10:24.26	meet the Unicorn again.

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 03:57:05.779664	12	00:00:30.58	00:00:32.1	the topic word distribution.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997084	13	00:00:33.28	00:00:36.47	So the idea is to assume that the text
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997084	14	00:00:36.47	00:00:38.67	data actually contain two kinds of
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997084	15	00:00:38.67	00:00:39.74	words.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997085	16	00:00:39.74	00:00:44.39	One kind is from the background here.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997085	17	00:00:45.7	00:00:49.835	So the is away etc and the other kind
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997085	18	00:00:49.835	00:00:52.74	is from our topic word distribution
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997085	19	00:00:52.74	00:00:54.01	that we're interested in.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997085	20	00:00:56.23	00:00:58.65	So in order to solve this problem of
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997085	21	00:00:58.65	00:01:01.74	factoring out background words, we can
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997086	22	00:01:01.74	00:01:05.73	set up our mixture model as follows.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997086	23	00:01:05.73	00:01:07.84	We're going to assume that we already
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997086	24	00:01:07.84	00:01:09.96	know the parameters of all the.

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997086	25	00:01:11.27	00:01:13.23	Values for all the parameters in the
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 03:58:00.931398	25	00:01:11.27	00:01:13.23	values for all the parameters in the
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997086	26	00:01:13.23	00:01:15.6	mixture model except for the world
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 03:58:11.880803	26	00:01:13.23	00:01:15.6	mixture model except for the word
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997087	27	00:01:15.6	00:01:18.45	distribution of theaters update, which
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 03:58:45.130295	27	00:01:15.6	00:01:18.45	distribution of theta sub d, which
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:17:55.090491	27	00:01:15.6	00:01:18.45	distribution of theta sub D, which
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997087	28	00:01:18.45	00:01:19.3	is our target.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:00:37.667915	28	00:01:18.45	00:01:19.3	is our target. So this is the case of customizing a probalistic model so that we embed the unknown variables that we are interested in, but we are going to simplify other things.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:01:35.921935	28	00:01:18.45	00:01:19.3	is our target. So this is the case of customizing a probalistic model so that we embed the unknown variables that we are interested in. But we are going to simplify other things. We are going to assume we have knowledge about others.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997087	29	00:01:34.06	00:01:35.85	And this is a powerful way of
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997087	30	00:01:35.85	00:01:38.42	customizing a model for a particular
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997087	31	00:01:38.42	00:01:39.39	need.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997088	32	00:01:39.39	00:01:40.89	Now you can imagine we could have
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997088	33	00:01:40.89	00:01:44.04	assumed that we also don't know the
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997088	34	00:01:44.04	00:01:46.38	background words, but in this case our
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:01:48.959465	34	00:01:44.04	00:01:46.38	background word distribution, but in this case our
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997088	35	00:01:46.38	00:01:49.71	goal is reflect out precisely those
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:02:04.134576	35	00:01:46.38	00:01:49.71	goal is factor out precisely those
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997088	36	00:01:49.71	00:01:51.709999	high probability background words.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997089	37	00:01:51.71	00:01:54.86	So we assume the background model is
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997089	38	00:01:54.86	00:01:55.59	already fixed.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997089	39	00:01:55.97	00:01:58.85	And the problem here is how can we
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997089	40	00:01:58.85	00:02:01.53	adjust theater sub D in order to
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:02:52.059662	40	00:01:58.85	00:02:01.53	adjust theta sub D in order to
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997089	41	00:02:01.53	00:02:03.66	maximize the probability of the
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99709	42	00:02:03.66	00:02:06.05	observed document here and we assume
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99709	43	00:02:06.05	00:02:07.48	all the other parameters or no.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:03:02.573201	43	00:02:06.05	00:02:07.48	all the other parameters are known.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99709	44	00:02:09.34	00:02:11.81	Now, although we designed the model
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99709	45	00:02:11.81	00:02:13.81	heuristically to try to figure out this
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:03:11.788331	45	00:02:11.81	00:02:13.81	heuristically to try to factor out this
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99709	46	00:02:13.81	00:02:14.72	background words.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99709	47	00:02:16.62	00:02:19.7	Unclear whether if we use maximum

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997091	48	00:02:19.7	00:02:22.27	likelihood estimator we will actually
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997091	49	00:02:22.27	00:02:24.6	end up having order distribution where
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997091	50	00:02:24.6	00:02:27.59	the common words like the will be
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997091	51	00:02:27.59	00:02:29.48	indeed having smaller probabilities
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997091	52	00:02:29.48	00:02:30.14	than before.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997092	53	00:02:30.89	00:02:31.86	So now.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997092	54	00:02:32.54	00:02:35.03	In this case, it turns out that the
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997092	55	00:02:35.03	00:02:36.75	answer is yes and.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:03:59.520658	55	00:02:35.03	00:02:36.75	answer is yes, and
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997092	56	00:02:38.04	00:02:40.27	When we set up the problem is volume.

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997092	57	00:02:40.27	00:02:42.38	This way when we use maximum likelihood
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:04:41.17057	57	00:02:40.27	00:02:42.38	this way when we use maximum likelihood
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997093	58	00:02:42.38	00:02:45.23	estimator we will end up having a word
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997093	59	00:02:45.23	00:02:47.91	distribution that where the common
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997093	60	00:02:47.91	00:02:50.579999	words will be factored out via the use
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997093	61	00:02:50.58	00:02:52.74	of the background distribution.

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997093	63	00:02:56.88	00:02:59.73	useful to examine the behavior of a
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997094	64	00:02:59.73	00:03:00.38	mixture model.

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997094	66	00:03:02.892856	00:03:05.62	simple case in order to understand some

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997095	71	00:03:16.062	00:03:18.45	to understand this behavior when we use
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997095	72	00:03:18.45	00:03:20.72	a very simple case like what we're

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997095	74	00:03:21.445	00:03:23.759999	So specifically in this case.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997096	75	00:03:24.1	00:03:26.14	Let's assume that the probability of
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997096	76	00:03:26.14	00:03:28.33	choosing each of the two models is
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997096	77	00:03:28.33	00:03:30.28	exactly the same, so we're going to
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997096	78	00:03:30.28	00:03:33.02	flip fair coin to decide which model to

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997097	81	00:03:36.22	00:03:38.44	there are precisely towards the end
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:05:42.722244	81	00:03:36.22	00:03:38.44	there are precisely two words: the and

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997097	84	00:03:42.34	00:03:46.06	oversimplification of the actual text,
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997098	85	00:03:46.06	00:03:48.48	but again it is useful to.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:06:04.721687	85	00:03:46.06	00:03:48.48	but again it is useful to examine

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:06:02.798793	86	00:03:49.98	00:03:51.78	the behavior in such a special
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997098	87	00:03:51.78	00:03:52.17	case.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997098	88	00:03:53.6	00:03:55.92	So we further assume that the
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997098	89	00:03:55.92	00:03:57.59	background model gives probability of

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997099	92	00:04:03.03	00:04:05.36	Now, let's also assume that our data is
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997099	93	00:04:05.36	00:04:06.51	extremely simple.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997099	94	00:04:06.51	00:04:08.37	The document has just the two words
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997099	95	00:04:08.37	00:04:09.21	text, Lambda.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:06:54.359114	95	00:04:08.37	00:04:09.21	text and the.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.9971	96	00:04:10.34	00:04:12.21	So now let's write down the likelihood
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.9971	97	00:04:12.21	00:04:14.25	function in such a case first.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:07:10.897385	97	00:04:12.21	00:04:14.25	function in such a case. First,
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.9971	98	00:04:15.31	00:04:17.156666	What's the probability of text and
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:07:09.569181	98	00:04:15.31	00:04:17.156666	what's the probability of text and
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.9971	99	00:04:17.156666	00:04:18.6	what's the problem in the of the?
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:07:23.221187	99	00:04:17.156666	00:04:18.6	what's the probability of the?
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.9971	100	00:04:19.45	00:04:21.49	I hope by this point and you will be
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997101	101	00:04:21.49	00:04:22.55	able to write it down.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997101	102	00:04:23.65	00:04:27.04	So the probability of text is basically
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997101	103	00:04:27.04	00:04:30.24	some over 2 cases, where each case
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:07:48.120855	103	00:04:27.04	00:04:30.24	the sum over 2 cases, where each case
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997101	104	00:04:30.24	00:04:32.92	corresponds to each of the water
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:07:56.427257	104	00:04:30.24	00:04:32.92	corresponds to each of the word
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997101	105	00:04:32.92	00:04:33.62	distribution.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997102	106	00:04:34.37	00:04:37.03	And accounts for the two ways of
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:08:02.868973	106	00:04:34.37	00:04:37.03	And it accounts for the two ways of
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997102	107	00:04:37.03	00:04:38.15	generating text.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997102	108	00:04:39.39	00:04:41.876666	An inside each case we have the
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997102	109	00:04:41.876666	00:04:43.74	probability of choosing the model which
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997102	110	00:04:43.74	00:04:47.22	is .5 multiplied by the probability of
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997103	111	00:04:47.22	00:04:49.62	observing text from that model.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997103	112	00:04:50.26	00:04:53.3	Similarly, the would have a probability
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997103	113	00:04:53.3	00:04:56.01	of the same form, just with different
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997103	114	00:04:56.01	00:04:57.56	exact probabilities.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997104	115	00:04:58.3	00:05:01.09	So naturally our likelihood function is
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997104	116	00:05:01.09	00:05:04.19	just the product of the two, so it's
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997104	117	00:05:04.19	00:05:06.93	very easy to see that.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997104	118	00:05:08.01	00:05:09.5075	Once you understand what's the
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997105	119	00:05:09.5075	00:05:11.55	probability of each word, which is also
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997105	120	00:05:11.55	00:05:14.44	why it's so important to understand
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997105	121	00:05:14.44	00:05:16.58	what exactly the probability of
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997105	122	00:05:16.58	00:05:18.11	observing each water from such a
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:08:45.167847	122	00:05:16.58	00:05:18.11	observing each word from such a
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997105	123	00:05:18.11	00:05:18.88	mixture model.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997106	124	00:05:19.55	00:05:21.62	Now the interesting question now is,
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997106	125	00:05:21.62	00:05:24.46	how can we then optimize this?
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:09:15.407697	125	00:05:21.62	00:05:24.46	how can we then optimize this
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997106	126	00:05:24.46	00:05:25.12	Like hold?
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:09:13.375668	126	00:05:24.46	00:05:25.12	likelihood?
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997106	127	00:05:25.12	00:05:28.02	Well, you will notice that there were
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997106	128	00:05:28.02	00:05:29.11	only two variables.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997107	129	00:05:29.11	00:05:30.609999	They are precisely the two
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997107	130	00:05:30.61	00:05:32.82	probabilities of the two words text and
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997107	131	00:05:32.82	00:05:35.17	the given by theaters of D.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:09:31.78282	131	00:05:32.82	00:05:35.17	the given by theta sub D.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997107	132	00:05:35.88	00:05:37.01	And this is the cause.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:09:43.386096	132	00:05:35.88	00:05:37.01	And this is because
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997108	133	00:05:37.01	00:05:38.89	We have assumed all the other
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:09:45.225831	133	00:05:37.01	00:05:38.89	we have assumed all the other
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997108	134	00:05:38.89	00:05:39.8	parameters are known.

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997108	136	00:05:44.14	00:05:45.5	algebra question, right?
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997108	137	00:05:45.5	00:05:47.703333	So we have a simple expression with two
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997109	138	00:05:47.703333	00:05:50.13	variables and we hope to choose the

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997109	141	00:05:54.17	00:05:57.21	And the exercise that we have seen some
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997109	142	00:05:57.21	00:06:00.86	simple algebra problems and notes that

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997109	143	00:06:00.86	00:06:03.27	the two probabilities must sum to one.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99711	144	00:06:03.27	00:06:04.9	So there's some constraint.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99711	145	00:06:06.23	00:06:08	If there were no constraint, of course
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99711	146	00:06:08	00:06:09.99	we would set both probabilities to
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99711	147	00:06:09.99	00:06:11.845	their maximum value, which would be one

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997111	149	00:06:13.4	00:06:16.48	But we can't do that 'cause text and

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997111	151	00:06:18.046	00:06:20.45	We can't give both a probability of 1.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997111	152	00:06:21.73	00:06:23.85	So now the question is how should we
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997112	153	00:06:23.85	00:06:25.86	allocate the probability mass between

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997114	162	00:06:44.48	00:06:46.766666	we'll see some interesting behavior of

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997121	201	00:08:09.153333	00:08:11.69	probability of text is now much larger

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997122	204	00:08:15.755	00:08:18.38	one distribution and this is clearly
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997122	205	00:08:18.38	00:08:20.28	because of the use of the background
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997122	206	00:08:20.28	00:08:22.71	model which assigns a very high

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997123	210	00:08:28.45	00:08:31.575	will see obviously some interaction of

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997124	213	00:08:37.07	00:08:39.97	make them equal and then the
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997124	214	00:08:39.97	00:08:44.17	probability assigned by senior sub D

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997124	218	00:08:51.83	00:08:55.62	Hi Ann, this is obvious from examining
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:15:29.257139	218	00:08:51.83	00:08:55.62	And, this is obvious from examining
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997125	219	00:08:55.62	00:08:57.7	this equation because the background
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997125	220	00:08:57.7	00:09:00.45	part is weak for text it's small.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997125	221	00:09:00.45	00:09:03.08	So in order to compensate for that we
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997125	222	00:09:03.08	00:09:05.48	must make the probability of text given
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997125	223	00:09:05.48	00:09:08.69	by Cedars up D somewhat larger so that
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:15:46.881917	223	00:09:05.48	00:09:08.69	by theta sub D somewhat larger so that
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997126	224	00:09:08.69	00:09:10.76	the two sides can be balanced.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997126	225	00:09:10.76	00:09:13.27	So this is in fact a very general
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997126	226	00:09:13.27	00:09:17.34	behavior of this mixture model, and
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997126	227	00:09:17.34	00:09:19.51	that is if one distribution assigns a
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997126	228	00:09:19.51	00:09:21.01	high probability to one word, then
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:16:04.006137	228	00:09:19.51	00:09:21.01	high probability to one word than
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997126	229	00:09:21.01	00:09:23.22	another, then the other distribution.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997127	230	00:09:23.3	00:09:25.14	Would tend to do the opposite.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997127	231	00:09:25.14	00:09:26.85	Basically it would discourage.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:16:21.096775	231	00:09:25.14	00:09:26.85	Basically it would discourage
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997127	232	00:09:26.85	00:09:28.62	Other distributions will do the same,
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-12-01 04:16:26.566422	232	00:09:26.85	00:09:28.62	other distributions to do the same,
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997127	233	00:09:28.62	00:09:31.71	and this is to balance them out so that
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997127	234	00:09:31.71	00:09:33.98	we can account for all kinds of words.
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997128	235	00:09:34.56	00:09:37.33	And this also means that by using a
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997128	236	00:09:37.33	00:09:39.43	background model that is fixed to
27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.997128	237	00:09:39.43	00:09:41.15	assign high probabilities to background

27d06808-2624-4922-a079-04dccb301dde	2020-11-02 23:15:04.99713	239	00:09:44.06	00:09:46.51	unknown topic world distribution to

2997c717-2552-411d-9dc4-7e648e16bbf0	2020-11-02 22:55:42.980948	193	00:07:52.48	00:07:54.989999	are applicable to any natural language.
2997c717-2552-411d-9dc4-7e648e16bbf0	2020-11-02 22:55:42.980948	194	00:07:54.99	00:07:57.02	That's a big advantage over other
2997c717-2552-411d-9dc4-7e648e16bbf0	2020-11-02 22:55:42.980949	195	00:07:57.02	00:08:00.116666	approaches that rely on more fragile
2997c717-2552-411d-9dc4-7e648e16bbf0	2020-11-02 22:55:42.980949	196	00:08:00.116666	00:08:02.16	natural language processing techniques.

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968702	36	00:01:31.87	00:01:34.6	logistic regression for binary setting

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968715	71	00:03:04.72	00:03:06.66	logistical regression for binary

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968717	74	00:03:10.56	00:03:11.62	multiple levels?
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968717	75	00:03:11.62	00:03:15.15	We actually use such a binary logistic
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968717	76	00:03:15.15	00:03:17.98	regression program to solve this multi
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968718	77	00:03:17.98	00:03:20.24	level rating prediction.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968718	78	00:03:20.91	00:03:23.21	And the idea is we can introduce
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968718	79	00:03:23.21	00:03:26.58	multiple binary classifiers and each
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968719	80	00:03:26.58	00:03:29.51	case we ask the classifier to predict
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968719	81	00:03:29.51	00:03:33.36	whether the rating is J or above all
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.96872	82	00:03:33.36	00:03:35.139999	the ratings lower than J.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.96872	83	00:03:35.14	00:03:38.3	So when Y subject is equal to 1, it
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:31:42.798172	83	00:03:35.14	00:03:38.3	So when Y_j is equal to 1, it
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968721	84	00:03:38.3	00:03:41.205714	means rating is J or above.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968721	85	00:03:41.205714	00:03:43.234999	When it's zero, that means the rating
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968721	86	00:03:43.234999	00:03:44.26	is lower than G.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:31:48.368061	86	00:03:43.234999	00:03:44.26	is lower than J.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968721	87	00:03:45.24	00:03:48.57	So basically, if we want to predict
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968722	88	00:03:48.57	00:03:51.235	rating in the range of one through K,
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968722	89	00:03:51.235	00:03:53.96	we first have one classifier to
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968722	90	00:03:53.96	00:03:56.21	distinguish K versus others.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968723	91	00:03:56.97	00:04:00	And that's our classifier one, and then
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968723	92	00:04:00	00:04:01.316666	we're going to have another classifier
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968723	93	00:04:01.316666	00:04:05.03	to distinguish K -- 1 from the rest.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:32:01.163107	93	00:04:01.316666	00:04:05.03	to distinguish K - 1 from the rest.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968724	94	00:04:05.67	00:04:08.28	That's classified too, and in the end
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:32:06.629829	94	00:04:05.67	00:04:08.28	That's classifier two, and in the end
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968724	95	00:04:08.28	00:04:10.3	we need a classifier to distinguish
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968725	96	00:04:10.3	00:04:12.169999	cool and well.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-27 22:24:02.68394	96	00:04:10.3	00:04:12.169999	two and one
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968725	97	00:04:13	00:04:15.64	So altogether we'll have K -- 1
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:32:11.128482	97	00:04:13	00:04:15.64	So altogether we'll have K - 1
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968725	98	00:04:15.64	00:04:16.56	classifiers.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968726	99	00:04:17.72	00:04:19.86	Now if we do that of course, then we
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968726	100	00:04:19.86	00:04:24.08	can also solve this problem, and the
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968727	101	00:04:24.08	00:04:25.77	logistical regression program would be
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968727	102	00:04:25.77	00:04:28.39	also very straightforward as you have
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968728	103	00:04:28.39	00:04:30.08	just seen on the previous slide.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968728	104	00:04:30.78	00:04:33.74	Only that here we have more parameters
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968728	105	00:04:33.74	00:04:36.14	because for each classify we need a
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968729	106	00:04:36.14	00:04:37.67	different set of parameters.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968729	107	00:04:38.35	00:04:40.25	So now the logistic regression
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968729	108	00:04:40.25	00:04:42.48	classifiers indexed by J, which

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968756	175	00:07:31.76	00:07:36.16	You can see the answer is that for each
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968757	176	00:07:36.16	00:07:39.24	classifier we have N + 1 parameters.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968757	177	00:07:39.86	00:07:41.87	And we have K -- 1 classifieds
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-27 22:26:58.976989	177	00:07:39.86	00:07:41.87	And we have K - 1 classifieds
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:34:56.956899	177	00:07:39.86	00:07:41.87	And we have K - 1 classifiers
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968758	178	00:07:41.87	00:07:44.08	altogether, so the total number of
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968758	179	00:07:44.08	00:07:48.96	premises K -- 1 * M + 1.

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968758	180	00:07:48.96	00:07:50.82	That's alot alot of parameters.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968759	181	00:07:50.82	00:07:53.978	So when the classifier has a lot of
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968759	182	00:07:53.978	00:07:56.354999	parameters would in general need a lot
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968759	183	00:07:56.354999	00:07:58.37	of data to actually help us training
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.96876	184	00:07:58.37	00:08:00.39	data to help us decide the optimal

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968761	188	00:08:07.1	00:08:09.565	The second problem is that these

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968762	190	00:08:13.14	00:08:15.17	not really independent.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968762	191	00:08:15.17	00:08:17.43	These problems are actually dependent.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968762	192	00:08:18.27	00:08:20.92	In general, words that are positive
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968763	193	00:08:20.92	00:08:25.27	would make the rating higher and for
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968763	194	00:08:25.27	00:08:28	any of these classifiers, for all these
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968764	195	00:08:28	00:08:28.64	classifiers.

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968764	197	00:08:30.433333	00:08:32.16	of this factor.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968765	198	00:08:32.89	00:08:35.6	Now the idea of ordinal logistic
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968765	199	00:08:35.6	00:08:37.82	regression is precisely that them.

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968766	201	00:08:41	00:08:43.805	the K -- 1 independent logistical

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968767	203	00:08:47.138	00:08:51.426666	is to tie these beta parameters and
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968767	204	00:08:51.426666	00:08:56.77	that means we are going to assume the.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-27 22:28:04.71173	204	00:08:51.426666	00:08:56.77	that means we are going to assume the

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968768	206	00:09:00.77	00:09:03.65	parameters that indicate the influence

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968769	209	00:09:07.16	00:09:10.79	values are the same for all the K -- 1

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968769	210	00:09:10.79	00:09:12.89	premise, and this just encodes our
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.96877	211	00:09:12.89	00:09:15.18	intuition that positive words in
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.96877	212	00:09:15.18	00:09:17.63	general would make a higher rating more
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.96877	213	00:09:17.63	00:09:18.12	likely.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968771	214	00:09:19.45	00:09:22.12	So this is intuitively appealing
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968771	215	00:09:22.12	00:09:22.57	assumption.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968771	216	00:09:22.57	00:09:25.03	It's reasonable for our problem set up
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968772	217	00:09:25.03	00:09:26.76	when we have this order in these
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968772	218	00:09:26.76	00:09:27.49	categories.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968772	219	00:09:28.5	00:09:31.88	Now, in effect, this would allow us to
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:36:01.344695	219	00:09:28.5	00:09:31.88	Now, in fact, this would allow us to
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968772	220	00:09:31.88	00:09:34.94	have two positive benefit of one is
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968773	221	00:09:34.94	00:09:36.32	it's going to reduce the number of
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968773	222	00:09:36.32	00:09:37.66	parameters significantly.

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968774	224	00:09:41.77	00:09:43.66	the training data, because all these
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968775	225	00:09:43.66	00:09:45.71	parameters are assumed to be equal.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968775	226	00:09:45.71	00:09:48.5	So these training data for different
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968775	227	00:09:48.5	00:09:49.34	classifiers.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968775	228	00:09:50.17	00:09:53.37	Can then be shared to help us set the
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968776	229	00:09:53.37	00:09:55.43	optimal value for beta.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968776	230	00:09:56.19	00:09:58.99	So we have more data to help us choose
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968776	231	00:09:58.99	00:10:00.12	a good, better value.

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968777	232	00:10:01.72	00:10:02.79	So what's the consequence?
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968777	233	00:10:02.79	00:10:05.12	The formula would look very similar to

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968777	235	00:10:07.83	00:10:11.056666	now the beta parameter has just one
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968778	236	00:10:11.056666	00:10:12.94	index that correspond to the feature

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968778	238	00:10:15.68	00:10:17.97	corresponds to the level of reading.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-27 22:29:15.291212	238	00:10:15.68	00:10:17.97	corresponds to the level of rating.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968779	239	00:10:19.16	00:10:22.28	So that means we tide them together and

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968781	245	00:10:35.2	00:10:37.62	and this is of course needed to predict
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968781	246	00:10:37.62	00:10:39.48	the different levels of ratings.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968781	247	00:10:39.48	00:10:41.83	So offer subject is different.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-27 22:29:36.229112	247	00:10:39.48	00:10:41.83	So apha subject is different.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968781	248	00:10:41.83	00:10:42.951428	It depends on J.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968782	249	00:10:42.951428	00:10:46.18	Different J has a different offer, but
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:36:39.777612	249	00:10:42.951428	00:10:46.18	Different J has a different alpha, but

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:36:53.049596	250	00:10:46.18	00:10:48.75	the rest of the parameters of beta
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968782	251	00:10:48.75	00:10:49.34	are the same.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968783	252	00:10:49.34	00:10:51.729999	So now you can also ask the question,
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968783	253	00:10:51.73	00:10:53.84	how many parameters do we have now?
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968783	254	00:10:53.84	00:10:55.42	Again, that's an interesting question
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968783	255	00:10:55.42	00:10:56.55	to think about.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968784	256	00:10:56.99	00:11:00.37	So if you think about it for a moment
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968784	257	00:11:00.37	00:11:03.513333	and you will see now the plan that we
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968784	258	00:11:03.513333	00:11:05.09	have far fewer parameters.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968784	259	00:11:05.09	00:11:08.02	Specifically, we have N + K -- 1
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-27 22:29:50.017539	259	00:11:05.09	00:11:08.02	Specifically, we have N + K - 1
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968785	260	00:11:08.02	00:11:11.524285	because we have M beta values and plus
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968785	261	00:11:11.524285	00:11:13.85	K minus one of our values.
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-28 08:37:11.481927	261	00:11:11.524285	00:11:13.85	K minus one alpha values.

2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968786	263	00:11:18.022	00:11:20.68	basically the main idea of ordinal
2d0e46c7-df4e-48b3-9550-dac3fec3062d	2020-11-02 23:10:07.968786	264	00:11:20.68	00:11:21.79	logistic regression.

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133704	75	00:03:11.63	00:03:14.06	solve the problem of parameter

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133705	78	00:03:17.32	00:03:20.51	would naturally contain context
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133705	79	00:03:20.51	00:03:23.23	variables, and in particular a lot of

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133706	82	00:03:29.83	00:03:31.29	And this would allow us to do
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133706	83	00:03:31.29	00:03:32.44	contextual text mining.

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133707	85	00:03:35.64	00:03:39.33	Now we don't have time to introduce
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133707	86	00:03:39.33	00:03:42.05	this model in detail, but there are
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133707	87	00:03:42.05	00:03:43.925	references here that you can look into

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133709	95	00:04:04.07	00:04:05.64	are still multiple topics.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13371	96	00:04:05.64	00:04:08.5	For example, some topics might
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13371	97	00:04:08.5	00:04:10.63	represent the themes like a government

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133711	101	00:04:17.19	00:04:20.779999	Hurricane Katrina and hit New Orleans.

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133711	103	00:04:26.2	00:04:30.21	are different views associated with the
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133712	104	00:04:30.21	00:04:31.6	each of the topics.

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133714	114	00:04:55.95	00:04:59.45	Now on the right side you we assume the
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-12-12 18:29:01.094254	114	00:04:55.95	00:04:59.45	Now on the right side you see we assume the
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-12-12 18:29:11.639123	114	00:04:55.95	00:04:59.45	Now on the right side you see now we assume the
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133714	115	00:04:59.45	00:05:01.38	document has contact information, so
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133714	116	00:05:01.38	00:05:05.27	the time is known to be July 2005,
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133714	117	00:05:05.27	00:05:07.11	locations, taxes, etc.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-12-12 18:29:23.928253	117	00:05:05.27	00:05:07.11	location is Texes, etc.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-12-12 18:29:33.191706	117	00:05:05.27	00:05:07.11	location is Texas, etc.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133715	118	00:05:07.11	00:05:10.21	Now such context information is what we
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133715	119	00:05:10.21	00:05:11.365	hope to model as well.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133715	120	00:05:11.365	00:05:12.95	So we're not going to just model the
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133715	121	00:05:12.95	00:05:13.37	text.

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133716	123	00:05:18.49	00:05:20.99	variations of top topic content in

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133716	125	00:05:22.82	00:05:25.25	different views of the world

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-12-12 18:30:54.596606	139	00:06:02.11	00:06:04.59	So to generate such a document with
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13372	140	00:06:04.59	00:06:07.94	context, we first also choose a view.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13372	141	00:06:08.59	00:06:11.42	And this view of course now could be
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13372	142	00:06:11.42	00:06:13.94	from any of these contexts.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13372	143	00:06:13.94	00:06:15.47	Let's say we have taken this view.

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133724	164	00:07:01.12	00:07:03.735	so the distribution of topics or the
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133725	165	00:07:03.735	00:07:06.34	coverage of topics can vary depending
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133725	166	00:07:06.34	00:07:08.65	on the context that has influenced the

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133725	168	00:07:09.89	00:07:11.79	So, for example, we might pick a
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133725	169	00:07:11.79	00:07:14.1	particular coverage, let's say in this
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133726	170	00:07:14.1	00:07:14.54	case.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133726	171	00:07:15.29	00:07:16.53	We pick up.

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133726	173	00:07:18.56	00:07:21.92	coverage now with the coverage and
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133726	174	00:07:21.92	00:07:23.7	these were distributions, we can
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-12-12 18:39:46.151173	174	00:07:21.92	00:07:23.7	these word distributions, we can
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133727	175	00:07:23.7	00:07:25.41	generate the document in exactly the

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133727	178	00:07:30.0675	00:07:32.83	coverage to choose a topic to choose

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133728	181	00:07:36.7025	00:07:40	the yellow topic, then withdraw world
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-12-12 18:40:05.609197	181	00:07:36.7025	00:07:40	the yellow topic, then withdraw a word
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133728	182	00:07:40	00:07:43.71	from this particular topic on the top.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133729	183	00:07:44.72	00:07:46.06	So we might get the warden.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-12-12 18:40:24.88433	183	00:07:44.72	00:07:46.06	So we might get the word
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133729	184	00:07:46.06	00:07:47.07	I get government.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-12-12 18:40:28.041309	184	00:07:46.06	00:07:47.07	like government.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133729	185	00:07:47.85	00:07:49.24	And then next time we might choose a
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133729	186	00:07:49.24	00:07:52.15	different topic, an will get donate,
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133729	187	00:07:52.15	00:07:54.99	etc right until we generate all the
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13373	188	00:07:54.99	00:07:56.81	words and this is basically the same
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13373	189	00:07:56.81	00:07:58.76	process as in PSA.

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13373	190	00:07:59.47	00:08:02.45	Now, so the main difference is when we
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13373	191	00:08:02.45	00:08:06.78	obtain the coverage and the word

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133731	195	00:08:12.58	00:08:15.506666	switches that are tide to this context

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133735	211	00:08:45.99	00:08:47.87	but similar models.
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133736	212	00:08:47.87	00:08:50.213333	So on this slide you see some sample
3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133736	213	00:08:50.213333	00:08:52.5	results of comparing news articles

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.133738	219	00:09:06.46	00:09:09.46	To review the common topics covered in

3103be2f-681e-41cf-b0f7-21cf6ba56616	2020-11-02 23:06:11.13374	224	00:09:20.17	00:09:22.96	explicitly specified by the topical

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748802	45	00:01:58.9	00:02:02.37	decisions on which documents should get
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748803	46	00:02:02.37	00:02:04.77	which category with what.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748803	47	00:02:06.05	00:02:07.66	Categories have been assigned to those
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748804	48	00:02:07.66	00:02:10.25	documents by humans and we want to
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748804	49	00:02:10.25	00:02:12.68	quantify the similarity of these
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748805	50	00:02:12.68	00:02:13.44	decisions.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748805	51	00:02:14.17	00:02:16.77	Or equivalently, to measure the
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748806	52	00:02:16.77	00:02:18.85	difference between the system output
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748806	53	00:02:18.85	00:02:22.855	and desired ideal output generated by
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748806	54	00:02:22.855	00:02:23.79	the humans?
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748807	55	00:02:24.9	00:02:27.55	So obviously the higher similarity is,
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748807	56	00:02:27.55	00:02:29.22	the better the results are.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748808	57	00:02:29.9	00:02:31.82	The similarity can be measured in
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748809	58	00:02:31.82	00:02:32.85	different ways.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748809	59	00:02:33.69	00:02:34.99	And that would lead to different
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748809	60	00:02:34.99	00:02:37.4	measures, and sometimes it's desirable
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74881	61	00:02:37.4	00:02:39.52	also to measure the similarity from
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74881	62	00:02:39.52	00:02:41.915	different perspectives just to have a
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74881	63	00:02:41.915	00:02:44.15	better understanding of the results in
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748811	64	00:02:44.15	00:02:44.64	detail.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748811	65	00:02:44.64	00:02:45.97	For example, it might be also
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748811	66	00:02:45.97	00:02:48.51	interested in knowing which category
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748812	67	00:02:48.51	00:02:51.25	performs better, which category is easy
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748813	68	00:02:51.25	00:02:53.2	to categorize, etc.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748813	69	00:02:54.63	00:02:57.66	In general, different categorization
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748814	70	00:02:57.66	00:03:01.23	mistakes, however, have different costs
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748814	71	00:03:01.23	00:03:04.11	for a specific application, so some
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748814	72	00:03:04.11	00:03:05.81	errors might be more serious than
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748815	73	00:03:05.81	00:03:06.335	others.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748815	74	00:03:06.335	00:03:09.57	So ideally we would like to model such
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748815	75	00:03:09.57	00:03:10.58	differences.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748816	76	00:03:10.58	00:03:13.17	But if you read many papers in texture
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748816	77	00:03:13.17	00:03:14.64	catalyzation, you will see that they
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748817	78	00:03:14.64	00:03:16.42	don't generally do that, and instead
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748817	79	00:03:16.42	00:03:18.67	they will use a simplified measure.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748817	80	00:03:19.38	00:03:20.88	And that's the cause.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748818	81	00:03:20.88	00:03:23.63	It's often OK not to consider such a
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748818	82	00:03:23.63	00:03:25.85	cost variation when we compare
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748818	83	00:03:25.85	00:03:27.31	different methods.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748819	84	00:03:27.31	00:03:30.155	An we when we are interested in knowing
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748819	85	00:03:30.155	00:03:32.775	the relative difference of these
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74882	86	00:03:32.775	00:03:33.25	methods.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74882	87	00:03:33.94	00:03:36.95	So it's OK to introduce some bias as
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74882	88	00:03:36.95	00:03:38.81	long as the bias is not correlated with
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748821	89	00:03:38.81	00:03:39.87	a particular method.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748821	90	00:03:40.68	00:03:42.99	And then we should still expect the
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748822	91	00:03:42.99	00:03:45.78	more effective method to perform better
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748822	92	00:03:45.78	00:03:48.77	than a less effective one, even though
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748823	93	00:03:48.77	00:03:50.65	the measure is not perfect.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748823	94	00:03:53.01	00:03:54.56	So the first measure that we will
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748823	95	00:03:54.56	00:03:55.99	introduce is called classification
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748824	96	00:03:55.99	00:03:57.53	accuracy, and this is basically to
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748825	97	00:03:57.53	00:03:59.06	measure the percentage of corrective
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748825	98	00:03:59.06	00:03:59.385	decisions.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748825	99	00:03:59.385	00:04:02.785	So here you show that here you see that
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748826	100	00:04:02.785	00:04:05.316666	there are K categories denoted by C1
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748826	101	00:04:05.316666	00:04:08.15	through CK and there are N documents in
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748827	102	00:04:08.15	00:04:11.455	order by D1 through DN an for each pair
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748827	103	00:04:11.455	00:04:13.23	of a category on the document that we
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748828	104	00:04:13.23	00:04:15.16	can then look at the situation.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748828	105	00:04:16.68	00:04:20.38	And see if the system has said yes to
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748829	106	00:04:20.38	00:04:20.96	despair.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748829	107	00:04:20.96	00:04:22.853333	Basically has assigned this category to
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748829	108	00:04:22.853333	00:04:25.46	this document or no, so this is denoted
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74883	109	00:04:25.46	00:04:26.9	by Y or N.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74883	110	00:04:26.9	00:04:28.783333	That's the system to decision.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74883	111	00:04:28.783333	00:04:30.65	And similarly we can look at the humans
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748831	112	00:04:30.65	00:04:31.06	decision.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748831	113	00:04:31.06	00:04:34.084	Also, if the human has assigned a
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748831	114	00:04:34.084	00:04:36.27	category to the document, there will be
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748832	115	00:04:36.27	00:04:37.6	a plus sign here.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748833	116	00:04:37.6	00:04:40.48	That's just that just means a human
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748833	117	00:04:40.48	00:04:42.68	would think this assignment is correct
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748834	118	00:04:42.68	00:04:45.22	an if the incorrect, and then there's a
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748834	119	00:04:45.22	00:04:45.9	minus.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748834	120	00:04:45.9	00:04:47.77	So we will see.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748835	121	00:04:47.82	00:04:51.44	All combinations of these ends yes and
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748835	122	00:04:51.44	00:04:53.112856	Nos with minus and plus.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748835	123	00:04:53.112856	00:04:55.5025	So there are four combinations in total
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748836	124	00:04:55.5025	00:04:58.865	and two of them are correct and when we
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748836	125	00:04:58.865	00:05:02.84	have Y plus or minus and then there are
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748836	126	00:05:02.84	00:05:04.15	also two kinds of errors.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748836	127	00:05:04.15	00:05:06.21	So the measure of classification
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748837	128	00:05:06.21	00:05:08.19	accuracy is similar to count how many
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748837	129	00:05:08.19	00:05:10.399999	of these decisions are correct and
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748837	130	00:05:10.4	00:05:12.59	normalize that by the total number of
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748837	131	00:05:12.59	00:05:13.78	decisions we have made.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748838	132	00:05:13.78	00:05:16.625714	So we know that the total number of
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748838	133	00:05:16.625714	00:05:17.439999	decisions is.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748838	134	00:05:18.01	00:05:19.52	In multiplied by K.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748839	135	00:05:20.19	00:05:22.3	And the number of characters decisions
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748839	136	00:05:22.3	00:05:24.89	obviously are basically of two kinds.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74884	137	00:05:24.89	00:05:27.5	One is why pluses and the other is N
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748841	138	00:05:27.5	00:05:29.54	minus is and we just put together the
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748841	139	00:05:29.54	00:05:30.15	account.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748841	141	00:05:32.81	00:05:35.04	that will give us a one number to
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748842	142	00:05:35.04	00:05:38.185	characterize performance of method and
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748842	143	00:05:38.185	00:05:39.77	the higher the better of course.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748843	144	00:05:40.37	00:05:42.65	But the method I also had some
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748843	145	00:05:42.65	00:05:43.58	problems.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748844	147	00:05:46.84	00:05:50.05	equally so, but in reality there's some
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748844	148	00:05:50.05	00:05:51.923333	decision errors are more serious than
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748845	149	00:05:51.923333	00:05:52.406666	others.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748867	202	00:07:52.73	00:07:53.43	balanced.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748867	203	00:07:54.72	00:07:56.6	And we wonder about equal number of
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748868	204	00:07:56.6	00:07:57.21	instances.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748868	205	00:07:57.21	00:08:00.19	For example, in each class the minority
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748869	206	00:08:00.19	00:08:02.6	categories or classes tend to be
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748869	207	00:08:02.6	00:08:04.84	overlooked in the evaluation of
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748869	208	00:08:04.84	00:08:05.92	classification accuracy.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74887	209	00:08:06.79	00:08:08.32	How to address these problems?
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74887	210	00:08:08.32	00:08:09.94	We of course would like to also
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748871	211	00:08:09.94	00:08:13.74	evaluate the results in other ways and
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748871	212	00:08:13.74	00:08:14.51	in different ways.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748871	213	00:08:14.51	00:08:16.3975	As I said, it's beneficial to look at
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748872	214	00:08:16.3975	00:08:18.135	the actual must multiple perspectives.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748872	215	00:08:18.135	00:08:20.3775	So for example, we can look at the
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748873	216	00:08:20.3775	00:08:22.78	perspective from each document
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748873	217	00:08:22.78	00:08:24.894	perspective based on each document.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748873	218	00:08:24.894	00:08:27.3	So the question here is, how could
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748873	219	00:08:27.3	00:08:28.81	other divisions on this document?
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748874	220	00:08:29.78	00:08:32.99	Now, as in the general cases of all
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748874	221	00:08:32.99	00:08:35.57	decisions, we can think about four
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748875	222	00:08:35.57	00:08:37.81	combinations of possibilities.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748875	223	00:08:38.39	00:08:40.221764	Depending on whether the system has
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748876	224	00:08:40.221764	00:08:42.358823	said yes, and depending on whether the
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748876	225	00:08:42.358823	00:08:44.42	human has said it correctly or
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748876	226	00:08:44.42	00:08:46.873333	incorrectly, or say yes or no, and so
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748877	227	00:08:46.873333	00:08:50.805	the four combinations are first.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748877	228	00:08:50.805	00:08:53.68	When both the human system said yes and
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748877	229	00:08:53.68	00:08:56.304999	that's true positives when the system
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748877	230	00:08:56.304999	00:08:58.48875	says yes, it's actually positive.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748878	231	00:08:58.48875	00:09:01.12	So when the system says yes, it's a
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748878	232	00:09:01.12	00:09:02.14	positive.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748879	233	00:09:02.14	00:09:04.52	But when the human confirmed that it is
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748879	234	00:09:04.52	00:09:06.51	indeed correct, that becomes true
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748881	235	00:09:06.51	00:09:06.96	positive.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748882	237	00:09:10.02	00:09:11.54	says no, that's incorrect.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748882	238	00:09:11.54	00:09:14.32	That's a false positive FP.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748883	239	00:09:14.9	00:09:16.89	And when the system says no, but the
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748883	240	00:09:16.89	00:09:19.13	human says yes, then it's a false
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748883	241	00:09:19.13	00:09:19.94	negative.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748884	242	00:09:19.94	00:09:21.55	We missed one assignment.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748884	243	00:09:22.12	00:09:25.59	When does the system and human said no?
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748884	244	00:09:25.59	00:09:27.61	Then that's also corrected vision.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748885	245	00:09:27.61	00:09:28.72	That's true negatives.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748898	284	00:10:50.66	00:10:52.83	And if you're interested in some
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748898	285	00:10:52.83	00:10:55.25	documents and this would tell us how
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748899	286	00:10:55.25	00:10:58.38	well we did that those documents a
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748899	287	00:10:58.38	00:10:59.88	subset of them might be more
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748899	288	00:10:59.88	00:11:00.743333	interesting than others.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748902	299	00:11:20.48	00:11:21.4	improving the better.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748903	300	00:11:22.23	00:11:24.52	Similarly, we can look at the popular
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748903	301	00:11:24.52	00:11:25.84	category valuation.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748903	302	00:11:25.84	00:11:26.0575	This.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748904	307	00:11:32.51	00:11:35.09	define precision and recall and it will
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748905	308	00:11:35.09	00:11:37.46	just basically answer the questions
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748905	309	00:11:37.46	00:11:38.89	from a different perspective.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74891	328	00:12:16.53	00:12:20.97	beta two to indicate the weather

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748911	332	00:12:28.24	00:12:31.43	in this case we just take a equal
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748912	333	00:12:31.43	00:12:34.34	weight on both precision and recall.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748912	334	00:12:34.34	00:12:37.98	If one is very often used as a measure
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748912	335	00:12:37.98	00:12:39	for categorisation.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748913	337	00:12:42.14	00:12:44.345	results, you always should think about
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748913	338	00:12:44.345	00:12:45.873333	the best way of combining them.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748913	339	00:12:45.873333	00:12:47.323333	So in this case I don't know if you
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748914	340	00:12:47.323333	00:12:49.316666	have thought about it and we could have
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748914	341	00:12:49.316666	00:12:52.14	combining them just with the arithmetic

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748915	346	00:12:57.87	00:12:59.339999	didn't do that and why.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748916	347	00:12:59.34	00:13:01.53	If one is more popular and it's

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748916	349	00:13:02.72	00:13:03.34	difference.

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748917	351	00:13:05.39	00:13:08.03	see that there is indeed some

3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748919	358	00:13:20.91	00:13:22.02	and nothing appears.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748919	359	00:13:22.64	00:13:24.095	And even tried to compute the precision
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748919	360	00:13:24.095	00:13:26.96	and recall in that case and see what
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74892	361	00:13:26.96	00:13:27.53	would happen.
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74892	362	00:13:28.28	00:13:32.885	I basically this kind of measure will
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74892	363	00:13:32.885	00:13:35.72	not the arithmetic mean is not going to
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.74892	364	00:13:35.72	00:13:38.48	be as reasonable FF1, which tends to
3956403f-f159-448a-9514-5dc69f314c5a	2020-11-02 22:58:06.748921	365	00:13:38.48	00:13:40.48	prefer a tradeoff between precision and

39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-12-09 01:51:29.065214	220	00:08:50.21	00:08:52.23	to have hierarchical categorization,
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.23146	221	00:08:52.23	00:08:54.36	where categories are formal hierarchy,
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-26 06:20:17.108005	221	00:08:52.23	00:08:54.36	where categories form hierarchy,

39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-26 06:24:43.261997	223	00:08:56.25	00:08:56.83	common. Yet another variation is joint categorization. That's when you have multiple categorization tasks that are related. And then you hope to kind of do joint categorization. Try to leverage the dependents of these tasks to improve accuracy for each individual task.

39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231462	225	00:09:17.095	00:09:19.67	categorization is most fundamental and
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231462	226	00:09:19.67	00:09:23.67	partly also because it's simple and
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231463	227	00:09:23.67	00:09:26.25	partly it's cause it can actually be
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231463	228	00:09:26.25	00:09:29.055	used to perform all the other
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231463	229	00:09:29.055	00:09:30.17	categorization tasks.

39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231464	231	00:09:33.59	00:09:37.41	task can be actually performed by using
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231465	232	00:09:37.41	00:09:38.76	binary categorization.

39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231468	239	00:09:55.463333	00:09:57.97	categorisation can also be done by
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231468	240	00:09:57.97	00:10:02.4	progressively doing flat categorisation
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231469	241	00:10:02.4	00:10:04.22	at each level.

39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.23147	245	00:10:08.655	00:10:10.486	categories an inside each category.
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231471	246	00:10:10.486	00:10:13	We can further categorize into sub
39d13817-de51-4195-a33a-985b0b54e64d	2020-11-02 23:19:19.231471	247	00:10:13	00:10:14.11	categories etc.

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206971	5	00:00:17.14	00:00:19.4	a maximum likelihood estimate, where we
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206972	6	00:00:19.4	00:00:21.86	simply normalize the observed accounts.

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206972	8	00:00:25.91	00:00:29.89	compute these probabilities as follows

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206973	14	00:00:45.98	00:00:46.36	here.

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206974	19	00:00:57.77	00:00:58.2	occur.

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206975	21	00:01:00.23	00:01:00.9	columns.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206975	22	00:01:01.49	00:01:03.32	In some other cases, only one word

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206976	24	00:01:05.485	00:01:07.25	the other column has zero.

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206976	26	00:01:10.16	00:01:12.22	of the words occur, so they are both
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206976	27	00:01:12.22	00:01:12.94	zeros.

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206977	30	00:01:17.4	00:01:18.83	simply need to collect the three
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206977	31	00:01:18.83	00:01:19.37	counts.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206977	32	00:01:20.23	00:01:22.73375	So the three counts of 1st, the count
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206977	33	00:01:22.73375	00:01:23.45125	of W.

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206978	35	00:01:24.97	00:01:27.409999	segments that contain world W one.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206978	36	00:01:27.41	00:01:30.676	It's just the ones in the column of W
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206978	37	00:01:30.676	00:01:33.129999	one we can just count how many ones we
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206978	38	00:01:33.13	00:01:33.89	have seen there.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206979	39	00:01:33.89	00:01:37.424444	The second counter is for word 2 an we
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-12-04 06:05:04.341157	39	00:01:33.89	00:01:37.424444	The second counter is for word 2 and we
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206979	40	00:01:37.424444	00:01:39.415555	just count the ones in the second
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206979	41	00:01:39.415555	00:01:39.699999	column.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206979	42	00:01:40.33	00:01:42.24	And these this would give us a total
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206979	43	00:01:42.24	00:01:44.73	number of segments that contain W2.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20698	44	00:01:45.39	00:01:48.67	The third account is when both words
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20698	45	00:01:48.67	00:01:51.38	occurred, so this is time we're going
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20698	46	00:01:51.38	00:01:53.51	to count the segments where both
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20698	47	00:01:53.51	00:01:55.43	columns have once.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-12-04 06:07:11.118764	47	00:01:53.51	00:01:55.43	columns have ones.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20698	48	00:01:56.05	00:01:58.444285	And then so this would give us the
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206981	49	00:01:58.444285	00:02:00.67	total number of segments where we have
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206981	50	00:02:00.67	00:02:03.13	seen both W and W2.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206981	51	00:02:03.13	00:02:06.01	Once we have these counts, we can just
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206981	52	00:02:06.01	00:02:06.58	normalize.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206981	53	00:02:06.58	00:02:09.251428	This comes by end, which is the total
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-12-04 06:07:30.41662	53	00:02:06.58	00:02:09.251428	These counts by n, which is the total
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206982	54	00:02:09.251428	00:02:11.156666	number of segments and this will give
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206982	55	00:02:11.156666	00:02:13.33	us the probabilities that we need to
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206982	56	00:02:13.33	00:02:14.86	compute mutual information.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206982	57	00:02:15.81	00:02:18.69	Now there is a small problem.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206982	58	00:02:18.69	00:02:21.182857	When we have zero counts sometimes and
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206983	59	00:02:21.182857	00:02:23.943333	in this case we don't want a zero
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206983	60	00:02:23.943333	00:02:26.31	probability because our data maybe a
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206983	61	00:02:26.31	00:02:29.28	small sample and in general we would
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206983	62	00:02:29.28	00:02:32.21	believe that it's potentially possible
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206983	63	00:02:32.21	00:02:34.46	for award to occur in any context.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206984	64	00:02:34.46	00:02:36.97	So to address this problem we can use a
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206984	65	00:02:36.97	00:02:39.17	technique called smoothing and that's
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206984	66	00:02:39.17	00:02:41.63	basically to add some small constant to
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206984	67	00:02:41.63	00:02:45.05	discounts and then so that we don't get
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206984	68	00:02:45.05	00:02:47.069999	a zero probability in any case.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206985	69	00:02:48.38	00:02:49.74	Now, the best way to understand the
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206985	70	00:02:49.74	00:02:52.39	smoothing is imagine that we actually.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206985	71	00:02:52.94	00:02:55.4	Observed more data than we actually
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206985	72	00:02:55.4	00:02:55.733333	have.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206985	73	00:02:55.733333	00:02:58.98	We will pretend we observe some pseudo

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206986	75	00:03:01.32	00:03:04.54	top on the right side of the slide and
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206986	76	00:03:04.54	00:03:07.95	these pseudo segments would contribute
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206986	77	00:03:07.95	00:03:10.74	additional counts of these words so

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206987	80	00:03:15.06	00:03:16.63	Now, in particular, we introduce the
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206987	81	00:03:16.63	00:03:18.32	four pseudo segments.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206987	82	00:03:18.32	00:03:20.34	Each is weighted 1/4.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206987	83	00:03:21.08	00:03:23.2	And these represent the four different
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206988	84	00:03:23.2	00:03:25.12	combinations of occurrences of these
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206988	85	00:03:25.12	00:03:25.67	words.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206988	86	00:03:25.67	00:03:29.2	So now each event, each combination
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206988	87	00:03:29.2	00:03:32.21	will have at least one count or at
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206988	88	00:03:32.21	00:03:33.35	least non zero counter.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206988	89	00:03:33.35	00:03:34.975	From these pseudo segment.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206989	90	00:03:34.975	00:03:38.205	So in the actual segments that we
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206989	91	00:03:38.205	00:03:40.49	observed, it's OK if we haven't
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206989	92	00:03:40.49	00:03:42.15	observed all the combinations.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206989	93	00:03:44.15	00:03:46.635	So more specifically, you can see the
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206989	94	00:03:46.635	00:03:47.75	point of five.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20699	95	00:03:47.75	00:03:50.83	Here actually comes from the two ones
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20699	96	00:03:50.83	00:03:53.42	in the two pseudo segments, because
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20699	97	00:03:53.42	00:03:56.4	each is weighted 1/4, we added them up.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20699	98	00:03:56.4	00:03:57.57	We get .5.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.20699	99	00:03:59.41	00:04:03.06	And similarly this .05 comes from one
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206991	100	00:04:03.06	00:04:06.51	single pseudo segment that indicates
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206991	101	00:04:06.51	00:04:08.4	the two words occur together.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206991	102	00:04:09.32	00:04:11.28	And of course, in the denominator we
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206991	103	00:04:11.28	00:04:13.76	add the total number of pseudo segments
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206992	104	00:04:13.76	00:04:14.363333	that we added.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206992	105	00:04:14.363333	00:04:17.115	In this case we added a 4th through the
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206992	106	00:04:17.115	00:04:17.46	segments.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206992	107	00:04:17.46	00:04:19.82	Each is weighted 1/4, so the total the
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206992	108	00:04:19.82	00:04:21.57	sum is actually one.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206992	109	00:04:21.57	00:04:23.37	So that's why in the denominator you
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206993	110	00:04:23.37	00:04:24.34	still want there.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206993	111	00:04:25.87	00:04:27.73	So this basically concludes the
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206993	112	00:04:27.73	00:04:29.65	discussion of how to compute the mutual
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206993	113	00:04:29.65	00:04:32.01	information, how to use this for
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206993	114	00:04:32.01	00:04:33.99	syntagmatic relation discovery.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206994	115	00:04:35.48	00:04:35.8	No.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206994	116	00:04:35.8	00:04:40.16	So, to summarize, select the cinematic
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206994	117	00:04:40.16	00:04:42.55	relation can generally be discovered by
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206994	118	00:04:42.55	00:04:44.04	measuring correlations between
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206994	119	00:04:44.04	00:04:45.465	occurrences of two words.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206995	120	00:04:45.465	00:04:47.81	We introduce the three concepts from
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206995	121	00:04:47.81	00:04:49.76	information theory, entropy, which
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206995	122	00:04:49.76	00:04:51.81	meshes uncertainly over random variable
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206995	123	00:04:51.81	00:04:55.31	X conditional entropy, which measures
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206995	124	00:04:55.31	00:04:56.32	the entropy of X.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206996	125	00:04:56.32	00:04:58.115	Given we know why.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206996	126	00:04:58.115	00:05:01.2	And mutual information of X&Y which
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206996	127	00:05:01.2	00:05:03.44	matches the entropy reduction of X.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206996	128	00:05:04.44	00:05:07.93	Due to knowing why or entropy reduction
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206996	129	00:05:07.93	00:05:10.54	of why do too knowing eggs?
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206997	130	00:05:11.14	00:05:13.41	They are the same, so these three
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206997	131	00:05:13.41	00:05:15.349999	concepts are actually very useful for
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206997	132	00:05:15.35	00:05:17.25	other applications as well.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206997	133	00:05:17.25	00:05:18.76	That's why we spend some time to
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206997	134	00:05:18.76	00:05:20.55	explain this in detail, but in
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206998	135	00:05:20.55	00:05:23.13	particular there also very useful for
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206998	136	00:05:23.13	00:05:25.08	discovering syntagmatic relations.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206998	137	00:05:25.65	00:05:29.51	In particular, mutual information is a
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206998	138	00:05:29.51	00:05:32.015	principled way for discovering such a
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206998	139	00:05:32.015	00:05:32.43	relation.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206999	140	00:05:32.43	00:05:35.77	It allows us to have values computer on
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206999	141	00:05:35.77	00:05:38.36	different pairs of words that are
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206999	142	00:05:38.36	00:05:40.98	comfortable, and so we can rank these
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206999	143	00:05:40.98	00:05:43.15	pairs and discover the strongest

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.206999	145	00:05:45.51	00:05:47.41	collection of documents.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207	146	00:05:47.41	00:05:50.21	Now note that there is some relation
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207	147	00:05:50.21	00:05:52.23	between syntactic medical relation
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207	148	00:05:52.23	00:05:55.02	discovery and paradigmatically relation

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207001	150	00:05:55.85	00:05:57.88	So we already discussed the possibility
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207001	151	00:05:57.88	00:06:02.87	of using PM 25 to achieve waiting for

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207001	152	00:06:02.87	00:06:05.94	terms in the context to potentially
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207001	153	00:06:05.94	00:06:08.22	also suggest the candidates that have
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207001	154	00:06:08.22	00:06:10.13	seen like medical relations with the
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207001	155	00:06:10.13	00:06:11.17	candidate word.
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207002	156	00:06:11.17	00:06:13.81	But here, once we use mutual
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207002	157	00:06:13.81	00:06:15.483333	information to discover Syntagmatic

44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207002	159	00:06:19.41	00:06:23.26	context with this mutual information as
44df41bc-04d3-41ca-ac51-dbd22dc98305	2020-11-02 23:11:30.207002	160	00:06:23.26	00:06:23.86	weights.

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903051	173	00:08:04.86	00:08:07.06	estimation in more detail.
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903052	174	00:08:07.86	00:08:11.68	OK, so I show the theater values as
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-12-10 19:05:09.032862	174	00:08:07.86	00:08:11.68	OK, so I show the theta values as
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903052	175	00:08:11.68	00:08:15.88	just a one dimension value and that's a
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-12-10 19:05:23.914533	175	00:08:11.68	00:08:15.88	just one dimension value and that's a

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903053	177	00:08:17.91	00:08:22.22	So we're interested in which value of

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903053	179	00:08:24.5	00:08:27.345	So now first we have the prior.
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903054	180	00:08:27.345	00:08:30.1	The prior tells us some data values are
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-12-10 19:05:46.104107	180	00:08:27.345	00:08:30.1	The prior tells us some theta values are
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903054	181	00:08:30.1	00:08:31.195	more likely than others.
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903055	182	00:08:31.195	00:08:33.5	We believe for example.

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903055	183	00:08:34.28	00:08:36.99	These values are more likely than the

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903055	184	00:08:36.99	00:08:40.31	values like here or here or other
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903056	185	00:08:40.31	00:08:41.02	places.
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903056	186	00:08:42.01	00:08:44.98	So this is our prior.
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903056	187	00:08:46.04	00:08:50.39	And then we have our data likelihood.
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903057	188	00:08:51.35	00:08:54.13	In this case, the data also tell us

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903057	189	00:08:54.13	00:08:56.43	which values of Theta are more likely

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-12-10 19:06:45.758337	190	00:08:56.43	00:08:58.41	and that just means those theta values
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903058	191	00:08:58.41	00:08:59.94	can best expand our data.
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-12-10 19:06:51.96549	191	00:08:58.41	00:08:59.94	can best explain our data.
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903058	192	00:09:01.75	00:09:03.689999	And then when we combine the two, we
48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903058	193	00:09:03.69	00:09:06.29	get the posterior distribution and

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903071	227	00:10:32.55	00:10:34.695	need to know the value of Theta.

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903072	231	00:10:41.49	00:10:42.49	values of Theta.

48b37a2f-5ca3-4b7b-9bfc-d841da37c566	2020-11-02 23:06:46.903073	233	00:10:44.82	00:10:48.396666	this function F as the expected value

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790336	45	00:01:49.46	00:01:52.34	for sure whether taxes from background

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790342	55	00:02:14.62	00:02:17.93	of the inferred values and then just
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790343	56	00:02:17.93	00:02:20.46	group words that are in the same

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790344	58	00:02:24.25	00:02:26.52	including this as well.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790345	59	00:02:27.18	00:02:30.973333	We can normalize the count to estimate

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790345	60	00:02:30.973333	00:02:34.105	the probabilities or to revise our

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79035	68	00:02:54.16	00:02:57.73	To help us re estimate the parameters.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79035	69	00:02:59.15	00:03:01.929999	That were interested in so these will
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790351	70	00:03:01.93	00:03:05.23	help us re estimate these parameters.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790351	71	00:03:05.23	00:03:07.89	But note that before we just set these
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790352	72	00:03:07.89	00:03:10.4	parameter values randomly, But with
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790352	73	00:03:10.4	00:03:13.12	this gas we will have a somewhat
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 02:36:30.550387	73	00:03:10.4	00:03:13.12	this guess we will have a somewhat
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790353	74	00:03:13.12	00:03:14.7	improved estimate of this.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790353	75	00:03:15.55	00:03:17.46	Of course, we don't know exactly
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790354	76	00:03:17.46	00:03:19.96	whether it's zero or one, so we're not
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790354	77	00:03:19.96	00:03:23.74	going to really do the split in
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790355	78	00:03:23.74	00:03:25.86	hardware, but rather we can do those
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790356	79	00:03:25.86	00:03:27.75	soft split and this is what happened
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790356	80	00:03:27.75	00:03:28.1	here.

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790357	82	00:03:31.72	00:03:34.63	By the probability that we believe this
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790358	83	00:03:34.63	00:03:37.78	would has been generated by using the

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79036	86	00:03:41.08	00:03:42.53	Where does this come from?
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79036	87	00:03:42.53	00:03:46.122	Well, this has come from here right
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790361	88	00:03:46.122	00:03:47.93	from the E step.

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790362	90	00:03:50.8	00:03:53.21	improve our initial estimate of

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790367	101	00:04:19.698333	00:04:21.97	of parameters, we're going to repeat
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790368	102	00:04:21.97	00:04:22.2675	this.

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790372	106	00:04:30.18	00:04:33.123333	another generation of re estimate the

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790379	119	00:05:07.21	00:05:10.38	Start with initial values that are
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79038	120	00:05:10.38	00:05:11.78	often randomly set.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79038	121	00:05:12.36	00:05:15.07	And then we invoke Eastep followed by M
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 02:40:10.356678	121	00:05:12.36	00:05:15.07	And then we invoke E step followed by M
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790381	122	00:05:15.07	00:05:18.84	step to get an improved setting of
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790381	123	00:05:18.84	00:05:21.02	parameters, and then we repeat this.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790382	124	00:05:21.02	00:05:23.25	So this is a Hill climbing algorithm
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 02:40:26.689034	124	00:05:21.02	00:05:23.25	So this is a hill climbing algorithm
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790382	125	00:05:23.25	00:05:24.94	that would gradually improve the
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790383	126	00:05:24.94	00:05:27.63	estimate of parameters and as I will
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790383	127	00:05:27.63	00:05:29.6	explain later, there's some guarantee
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790384	128	00:05:29.6	00:05:31.52	for reaching a local maximum.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 02:40:40.842129	128	00:05:29.6	00:05:31.52	for reaching a local maximum
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790384	129	00:05:32.18	00:05:33.57	Of the likelihood function.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 02:40:41.952094	129	00:05:32.18	00:05:33.57	of the likelihood function.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790385	130	00:05:35.21	00:05:37.91	So let's take a look at the computation
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790386	131	00:05:37.91	00:05:39.64	for specific case.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790386	132	00:05:39.64	00:05:42.99	So these formulas are the M formulas
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 02:40:56.540926	132	00:05:39.64	00:05:42.99	So these formulas are the EM formulas
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790387	133	00:05:42.99	00:05:45.745	that you see before, and you can also
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790387	134	00:05:45.745	00:05:50.57	see there are superscripts here N to
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790388	135	00:05:50.57	00:05:52.95	indicate the generation of parameters.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790389	136	00:05:53.61	00:05:54.3	I go here.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790389	137	00:05:54.3	00:05:56.07	For example, we have N + 1.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79039	138	00:05:56.07	00:05:59.69	That means we have improved parameters
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79039	139	00:05:59.69	00:06:01.16	from here to.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790391	140	00:06:01.16	00:06:03.16	Here we have improvement.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 02:43:02.006924	140	00:06:01.16	00:06:03.16	here we have improvement.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790391	141	00:06:04.12	00:06:06.185	So in this setting we have assumed that
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790392	142	00:06:06.185	00:06:08.2	the two models have equal probabilities
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790392	143	00:06:08.2	00:06:09.605	and the background model is known.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790393	144	00:06:09.605	00:06:11.84	So what are the relevant statistics?
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790393	145	00:06:11.84	00:06:13.46	Well, these are the word counts.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790394	146	00:06:14.03	00:06:16.61	So assume we have just 4 words and
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790394	147	00:06:16.61	00:06:18.82	their counts are like this and this is
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790395	148	00:06:18.82	00:06:21.56	our background model that assigns high
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790395	149	00:06:21.56	00:06:23.61	probabilities to common words like the.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790396	150	00:06:25.81	00:06:28.76	An in the first iteration you can
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790396	151	00:06:28.76	00:06:29.78	picture what would happen.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790397	152	00:06:29.78	00:06:31.82	Well, we first we initialize all
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790397	153	00:06:31.82	00:06:32.32	values.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 02:45:40.780526	153	00:06:31.82	00:06:32.32	the values.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790398	154	00:06:32.32	00:06:34.68	So here this probability that we're
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790398	155	00:06:34.68	00:06:36.47	interested in is normalized into an
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790399	156	00:06:36.47	00:06:38.53	uniform distribution over all the
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790399	157	00:06:38.53	00:06:38.92	words.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.7904	158	00:06:39.58	00:06:41.66	And then the E step would give us a
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.7904	159	00:06:41.66	00:06:42.14	guess.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790401	160	00:06:43.32	00:06:45.915	Of the distribution that has been used
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790401	161	00:06:45.915	00:06:49.522	to generate each word, we can see we
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790402	162	00:06:49.522	00:06:50.73	have different probabilities for
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790402	163	00:06:50.73	00:06:51.42	different words.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790403	164	00:06:51.42	00:06:54.819999	Why that's be cause these words have
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790403	165	00:06:54.819999	00:06:56.286666	different probabilities in the
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790404	166	00:06:56.286666	00:06:56.653332	background.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790404	167	00:06:56.653332	00:06:58.48	So even though the two distributions
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790405	168	00:06:58.48	00:07:01.42	are equally likely, and then our
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790405	169	00:07:01.42	00:07:03.45	initialization says uniform
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790405	170	00:07:03.45	00:07:05.23	distribution because of the difference
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790406	171	00:07:05.23	00:07:06.6675	in the background world distribution,
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790406	172	00:07:06.6675	00:07:09.096	we have different guest probabilities.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790406	173	00:07:09.096	00:07:12.53	So these words are believed to be more
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790407	174	00:07:12.53	00:07:14.39	likely from the topic.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790407	175	00:07:15.42	00:07:17.05	These, on the other hand, are less
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790408	176	00:07:17.05	00:07:18.93	likely probably from background.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790408	177	00:07:20.14	00:07:23.1	So once we have the Z values, we know
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790409	178	00:07:23.1	00:07:25.73	in the end step these probabilities
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 03:13:55.999472	178	00:07:23.1	00:07:25.73	in the E step these probabilities
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790409	179	00:07:25.73	00:07:28.446666	would be used to adjust the counts.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79041	180	00:07:28.446666	00:07:32.3275	So for must be multiplied by this point
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 03:14:06.078332	180	00:07:28.446666	00:07:32.3275	So 4 must be multiplied by this point
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79041	181	00:07:32.3275	00:07:36.46	3, three in order to get the allocated

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790414	190	00:07:59.926666	00:08:02.186	going to be 1.0, so we're going to just
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790414	191	00:08:02.186	00:08:04.48	get some percentage of the counts

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790415	193	00:08:07.41	00:08:08.79	normalize these counts.

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790417	198	00:08:20.06	00:08:22.19	see at the probability is different.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790418	199	00:08:22.19	00:08:25.285	Not only that, we also see some words
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790418	200	00:08:25.285	00:08:27.38	that are believed to have come from the

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790419	203	00:08:30.16	00:08:30.62	text.

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.79042	205	00:08:34.28	00:08:35.9	parameters would allow us to further
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790421	206	00:08:35.9	00:08:41.12	adjust the infer the latent variable or
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790421	207	00:08:41.12	00:08:42.519999	hidden variable values.

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790422	209	00:08:44.71	00:08:48.26	because of the E step based on the new
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790422	210	00:08:48.26	00:08:49.76	generation of parameters.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790423	211	00:08:51.04	00:08:54.74	And this these new in further values of
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790423	212	00:08:54.74	00:08:57.05	these will give us then another
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790423	213	00:08:57.05	00:09:00.87	generation of the estimate of

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790424	215	00:09:03.26	00:09:04.63	And so on so forth.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790424	216	00:09:04.63	00:09:06.74	So this is what would actually happen
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790425	217	00:09:06.74	00:09:09.37	when we compute these probabilities
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790425	218	00:09:09.37	00:09:11.36	using the EM algorithm.

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-12-05 03:41:00.759672	219	00:09:11.36	00:09:14.51	And as you can see in the last rule where
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790426	220	00:09:14.51	00:09:17.6	we showed the log like code and the
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790426	221	00:09:17.6	00:09:19.66	likelihood is increasing as we do the
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790427	222	00:09:19.66	00:09:20.25	iteration.

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790428	224	00:09:23.175	00:09:25.8	negative becausw the probability is
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790428	225	00:09:25.8	00:09:27.33	between zero and one when you take
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790428	226	00:09:27.33	00:09:29.35	logarithm, it becomes a negative value.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790429	227	00:09:29.94	00:09:32.51	What's also interesting is do not last

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790431	232	00:09:44.446666	00:09:47.105	In this case the topic distribution,
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790431	233	00:09:47.105	00:09:49.68	and you might wonder whether this would
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790431	234	00:09:49.68	00:09:51.663333	be also useful because our main goal is
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790432	235	00:09:51.663333	00:09:55.25	to estimate these world distribution

4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790432	237	00:09:55.55	00:09:57.42	So this is our primary goal.
4c3d9363-8e43-44fe-ab21-8740cfd1a8c5	2020-11-02 23:01:52.790433	238	00:09:57.42	00:09:59.42	We hope to have a more discriminating

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377478	92	00:03:59.63	00:04:02.28	So in the case of Naive Bayes, we
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377479	93	00:04:02.28	00:04:04.68	compute this by using baseball and

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37748	95	00:04:07.765	00:04:09.603333	that look like this.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377481	96	00:04:09.603333	00:04:10.78	That looks like this.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377481	97	00:04:12.87	00:04:17.08	But here we actually would assume
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377482	98	00:04:17.08	00:04:22.35	explicitly that we would model our.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377485	103	00:04:40.82	00:04:45.71	log of the ratio of probability of y =

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377486	105	00:04:48.96	00:04:51.51	Is a function of X.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377487	107	00:04:56.85	00:04:58.85	linear combination of these feature

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:15:04.750411	109	00:05:02.24	00:05:05.346	And since we know that probability of
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377489	110	00:05:05.346	00:05:10.74	y = 0 is 1 minus probability of y = 1,

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37749	112	00:05:14.04	00:05:14.4	way.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377491	113	00:05:15.89	00:05:19.02	So this is a log out ratio.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:15:20.718557	113	00:05:15.89	00:05:19.02	So this is a log odds ratio.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377492	114	00:05:19.7	00:05:20.29	Here.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:15:34.873029	117	00:05:25.505	00:05:31.77	of y = 1  given X is dependent on this

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377496	121	00:05:36.38	00:05:39.53	ways of assuming that the dependency,

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377499	126	00:05:48.99	00:05:51.57	actually express the probability of Y
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.3775	127	00:05:51.57	00:05:54.97	given X in terms of X by taking by
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377501	128	00:05:54.97	00:05:56.86	getting rid of the logarithm and we get
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377501	129	00:05:56.86	00:05:58.81	this functional form and this is called
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377502	130	00:05:58.81	00:06:01.13	a logistical function, it's a
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377502	131	00:06:01.13	00:06:04.59	transformation of X into Y.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377503	132	00:06:06.33	00:06:07.22	As you see.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377504	133	00:06:08.71	00:06:09.78	Right side here.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-08 06:28:15.108847	133	00:06:08.71	00:06:09.78	on the right side here.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377504	134	00:06:10.42	00:06:14.32	I saw that the eggs will be mapped into
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:16:21.991497	134	00:06:10.42	00:06:14.32	So that the Xs will be mapped into
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377505	135	00:06:14.32	00:06:17.51	a range of values from zero to 1.0.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377506	136	00:06:18.42	00:06:20.86	You can see, and that's precisely what
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377506	137	00:06:20.86	00:06:21.41	we want.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377507	138	00:06:21.41	00:06:23.36	Since we have a probability here.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377507	139	00:06:24.21	00:06:26.73	And the function form looks like this.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377508	140	00:06:27.82	00:06:30.78	So this is the basic idea of logistic
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377509	141	00:06:30.78	00:06:33.33	regression, and it's very useful
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-08 06:28:39.154052	141	00:06:30.78	00:06:33.33	regression, and it's a very useful
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377509	142	00:06:33.33	00:06:35.44	classifier that can be used to do a lot
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37751	143	00:06:35.44	00:06:38.21	of classification tasks, including text
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37751	144	00:06:38.21	00:06:39.08	categorisation.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-08 06:28:45.850338	144	00:06:38.21	00:06:39.08	categorization.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377511	146	00:06:44.3	00:06:46.16	be interested in estimating the

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377513	148	00:06:48.21	00:06:49.31	learning programs.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377513	149	00:06:49.31	00:06:51.33	Once you set up the model set of
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377514	150	00:06:51.33	00:06:52.57	objective function.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377514	151	00:06:53.14	00:06:57.05	To model the classifier, then the next
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377515	152	00:06:57.05	00:06:59.5	step is to compute the parameter
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377516	153	00:06:59.5	00:06:59.855	values.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377517	154	00:06:59.855	00:07:01.856666	In general, we're going to adjust these
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377517	155	00:07:01.856666	00:07:03.83	parameter values, optimize the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377518	156	00:07:03.83	00:07:05.68	performance of classifier on the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377518	157	00:07:05.68	00:07:06.28	training data.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377519	158	00:07:06.28	00:07:08.576666	So in our case, let's assume we have
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37752	159	00:07:08.576666	00:07:09.689999	training data.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37752	160	00:07:09.689999	00:07:13.31	The training data here, Zion, why I and
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:17:29.571047	160	00:07:09.689999	00:07:13.31	The training data here, X i and Y i and
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37752	161	00:07:13.31	00:07:16.54	each pair is basically feature vector
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377521	162	00:07:16.54	00:07:21.5	of X and known label for that XYZ,
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:17:42.225774	162	00:07:16.54	00:07:21.5	of X and a known label for that X Y,
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377521	163	00:07:21.5	00:07:22.84	either one or zero.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377522	164	00:07:23.79	00:07:26.83	So in our case we are interested in
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377523	165	00:07:26.83	00:07:29.97	maximizing this conditional likelihood.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377523	166	00:07:30.69	00:07:33.96	The condition will likely hold here is
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:17:56.628621	166	00:07:30.69	00:07:33.96	The condition likelihood here is
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377524	167	00:07:33.96	00:07:38.42	basically to model why given the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-08 06:29:42.673986	167	00:07:33.96	00:07:38.42	basically to model y given the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377524	168	00:07:38.42	00:07:39.67	observed X.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377525	169	00:07:41.14	00:07:43.35	So it's not like a.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377525	170	00:07:44.21	00:07:47.11	It's not like a modeling X, but rather
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377526	171	00:07:47.11	00:07:48.53	we're going to model this.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377526	172	00:07:50.94	00:07:52.65	Note that this is a conditional
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377527	173	00:07:52.65	00:07:55.19	probability of Y given X.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377528	174	00:07:56.4	00:07:59.03	And this is also precisely what we want
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377528	175	00:07:59.03	00:08:00.03	for classification.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377529	176	00:08:00.65	00:08:02.56	Now, so the likelihood function would
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37753	177	00:08:02.56	00:08:04.38	be just a product over all the training
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37753	178	00:08:04.38	00:08:05.01	cases.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377531	179	00:08:06.62	00:08:09.74	And in each case, this is the model.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:18:43.304772	179	00:08:06.62	00:08:09.74	And in each case, this is the modeled
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377532	180	00:08:09.74	00:08:11.535	The probability of observing this
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:18:46.012876	180	00:08:09.74	00:08:11.535	probability of observing this
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377532	181	00:08:11.535	00:08:12.87	particular training case.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377533	182	00:08:12.87	00:08:16.97	So given a particular XI, how likely
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377533	183	00:08:16.97	00:08:19.346666	will observe the corresponding why?
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:19:03.089373	183	00:08:16.97	00:08:19.346666	will we are going to observe the corresponding why?
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:19:16.598156	183	00:08:16.97	00:08:19.346666	we are going to observe the corresponding Y i
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377534	184	00:08:19.346666	00:08:21.956666	I of course, why I could be one or zero
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:19:19.229866	184	00:08:19.346666	00:08:21.956666	of course, why I could be one or zero
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:19:21.788064	184	00:08:19.346666	00:08:21.956666	of course, Y I could be one or zero
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377535	185	00:08:21.956666	00:08:23.89	and in fact the function form here
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377535	186	00:08:23.89	00:08:27.33	would vary depending on whether Y sub I
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377536	187	00:08:27.33	00:08:28.89	is one or zero.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377537	188	00:08:28.89	00:08:32.14	If it's one will be taking this form.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377537	189	00:08:33.56	00:08:35.23	And that's basically the logistical

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377583	262	00:11:29.31	00:11:31.82	might use them often for text
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377583	263	00:11:31.82	00:11:33.05	categorization.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377584	264	00:11:33.05	00:11:35.67	So the second classifier, colon key
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:23:45.890706	264	00:11:33.05	00:11:35.67	So the second classifier, is called k
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377584	265	00:11:35.67	00:11:36.53	nearest neighbors.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377585	266	00:11:36.53	00:11:39.63	In this approach, we're going to also
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377585	267	00:11:39.63	00:11:42.67	estimate the conditional probability of
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377586	268	00:11:42.67	00:11:43.06	label.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377587	269	00:11:43.11	00:11:44.73	Given data, but even a very different
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:23:54.179819	269	00:11:43.11	00:11:44.73	Given data, but in a very different
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377587	270	00:11:44.73	00:11:45.02	way.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377588	271	00:11:45.02	00:11:48.674	So the idea is to keep all the training
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377589	272	00:11:48.674	00:11:50.664	examples and then once we see a text
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377589	273	00:11:50.664	00:11:53.03	object that we want to classify, we're
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37759	274	00:11:53.03	00:11:55.315714	going to find the K examples in the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37759	275	00:11:55.315714	00:11:57.58	training set and that are most similar
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377591	276	00:11:57.58	00:11:59.19	to this text object.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377591	277	00:11:59.19	00:12:01.47	Basically this is to find the neighbors
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377592	278	00:12:01.47	00:12:04.487777	of this text object in the training
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377592	279	00:12:04.487777	00:12:05.349999	data set.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377594	281	00:12:08.11	00:12:10.48	neighborhood and found the objects that
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377595	282	00:12:10.48	00:12:11.73	are close to the.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377595	283	00:12:12.45	00:12:14.3	The object were interested in

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377596	284	00:12:14.3	00:12:17.49	classifying and say we have found the K
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377596	285	00:12:17.49	00:12:18.37	nearest neighbors.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377597	286	00:12:18.37	00:12:20.2725	That's why this method is called K
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377598	287	00:12:20.2725	00:12:21.0575	nearest neighbors.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377604	298	00:12:40.33	00:12:41.97	object will have category one.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377605	299	00:12:42.97	00:12:44.3	This approach, it counts, will be
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:25:41.182251	299	00:12:42.97	00:12:44.3	This approach, can also be improved
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377605	300	00:12:44.3	00:12:46.894	improved by considering the distance of

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377608	305	00:12:56.052	00:12:58.11	have we can give such a neighbor more
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377609	306	00:12:58.11	00:13:01.26	influence on the vote and we can take
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37761	307	00:13:01.26	00:13:03.765	away to some of their votes based on

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377611	310	00:13:07.6	00:13:09.85	neighborhood and then try to assess the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377612	311	00:13:09.85	00:13:11.92	category based on the categories of the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377612	312	00:13:11.92	00:13:12.52	neighbors.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377614	314	00:13:15.83	00:13:18.68	But mathematically, this can also be
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377614	315	00:13:18.68	00:13:21.67	regarded as a way to directly estimate
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377615	316	00:13:21.67	00:13:23.4	the conditional probability of label
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377616	317	00:13:23.4	00:13:26.95	given data that is P of Y given X.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377616	318	00:13:28.04	00:13:29.63	Now I'm going to explain this intuition
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377617	319	00:13:29.63	00:13:32.19	in the moment, but before we proceed,

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377622	327	00:13:48.11	00:13:48.57	either.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377622	328	00:13:48.57	00:13:50.66	But here we explicitly requires
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:26:53.842541	328	00:13:48.57	00:13:50.66	But here we explicitly requires a
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377623	329	00:13:50.66	00:13:51.7	similarity function.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377624	330	00:13:52.38	00:13:54.309999	Now this is similar to function.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:27:02.572982	330	00:13:52.38	00:13:54.309999	Now this is similarity function.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-08 06:36:03.728155	330	00:13:52.38	00:13:54.309999	Now this similarity function.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377625	331	00:13:54.31	00:13:57.69	Actually is a good opportunity for us
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377625	332	00:13:57.69	00:14:01.21	to inject any of our insights about

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377627	335	00:14:06.11	00:14:09.131428	that would make the objects that are in
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377628	336	00:14:09.131428	00:14:12.42	the same category look more similar,
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377628	337	00:14:12.42	00:14:15.17	but distinguishing objects in different
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377629	338	00:14:15.17	00:14:16.48	categories.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37763	339	00:14:16.48	00:14:18.33	So the design of this similarity
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37763	340	00:14:18.33	00:14:20.705	function is closely tide to the design
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:27:29.142912	340	00:14:18.33	00:14:20.705	function is closely tied to the design
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377631	341	00:14:20.705	00:14:23.01	of the features in logistic regression.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377631	342	00:14:23.55	00:14:25.62	Another classifiers, so let's
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:27:38.10488	342	00:14:23.55	00:14:25.62	and other classifiers, so let's
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377632	343	00:14:25.62	00:14:28.22	illustrate how K and then works.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:27:43.921201	343	00:14:25.62	00:14:28.22	illustrate how K-NN works.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377633	344	00:14:28.22	00:14:30.69	Suppose we have a lot of training
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377633	345	00:14:30.69	00:14:31.67	instances here.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377634	346	00:14:32.23	00:14:35.346666	And I've colored them differently and
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377635	347	00:14:35.346666	00:14:38.49	to show just different categories.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377635	348	00:14:38.49	00:14:40.67	Now suppose we have a new object in the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377636	349	00:14:40.67	00:14:42.99	center that we want to classify.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377637	350	00:14:43.55	00:14:45.15	So according to this approach will work
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:28:02.991463	350	00:14:43.55	00:14:45.15	So according to this approach we're going to 
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377637	351	00:14:45.15	00:14:46.38	in the final neighbors.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:28:06.901792	351	00:14:45.15	00:14:46.38	find neighbors.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:28:09.732711	351	00:14:45.15	00:14:46.38	find the neighbors.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377639	352	00:14:46.38	00:14:48.61	And let's first think of a special case
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37764	353	00:14:48.61	00:14:51.29	of finding just one neighbor closest
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:28:19.282794	353	00:14:48.61	00:14:51.29	of finding just one neighbor, the closest
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377641	354	00:14:51.29	00:14:51.66	neighbor.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377641	355	00:14:52.95	00:14:55	Now in this case, if the, let's assume
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377642	356	00:14:55	00:14:57.83	the closest neighbor is the box filled
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377642	357	00:14:57.83	00:15:01.855714	with diamonds an so then we're going to
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-08 06:37:04.816952	357	00:14:57.83	00:15:01.855714	with diamonds and so then we're going to
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377643	358	00:15:01.855714	00:15:02.252856	say.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377643	359	00:15:02.252856	00:15:06.3725	Well, since this is in, this object is
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377644	360	00:15:06.3725	00:15:08.030833	in category of diamonds.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377645	361	00:15:08.030833	00:15:10.206666	Let's say then we're going to say,
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377645	362	00:15:10.206666	00:15:12.56	well, we're going to assign the same
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377646	363	00:15:12.56	00:15:15.14	Category 2 hour types object.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:28:41.145865	363	00:15:12.56	00:15:15.14	Category to our text object.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377646	364	00:15:17.13	00:15:18.86	But let's also look at the another
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377647	365	00:15:18.86	00:15:20.49	possibility of finding a larger
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377648	366	00:15:20.49	00:15:21.32	neighborhood.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377648	367	00:15:21.32	00:15:24.41	So let's think about the four
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377649	368	00:15:24.41	00:15:25.23	neighbors.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377649	369	00:15:25.92	00:15:27.73	In this case, we're going to include a
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37765	370	00:15:27.73	00:15:30.78	lot of other solid field boxes in red
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37765	371	00:15:30.78	00:15:31.35	or pink.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377651	372	00:15:32.1	00:15:36.32	So in this case now we will notice that
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:29:03.836405	372	00:15:32.1	00:15:36.32	So in this case now we  are going to notice that
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377651	373	00:15:36.32	00:15:38.24	among the four neighbors there after
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:29:15.017056	373	00:15:36.32	00:15:38.24	among the four neighbors there are actually
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377652	374	00:15:38.24	00:15:40.496666	three neighbors in a different
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377653	375	00:15:40.496666	00:15:40.993333	category.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377653	376	00:15:40.993333	00:15:43.53	So if we take a vote, then we'll
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377654	377	00:15:43.53	00:15:46.61	conclude the object is actually over
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:29:22.00117	377	00:15:43.53	00:15:46.61	conclude the object is actually of a
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377654	378	00:15:46.61	00:15:47.57	different category.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377655	379	00:15:47.57	00:15:50.23	So this both illustrates how can
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:29:28.092143	379	00:15:47.57	00:15:50.23	So this both illustrates how K
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377655	380	00:15:50.23	00:15:52.7	nearest neighbor works and also
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377656	381	00:15:52.7	00:15:55.925	illustrates some potential problems of
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377656	382	00:15:55.925	00:15:56.65	this classifier.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377657	383	00:15:56.65	00:15:58.405	Basically the results might depend on

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377659	387	00:16:07.53375	00:16:10	have a lot of neighbors around this
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377659	388	00:16:10	00:16:13.221428	object and then we'll be OK because we
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37766	389	00:16:13.221428	00:16:14.79	have a lot of neighbors for help us

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377661	391	00:16:16.1	00:16:19.11	But if we have only a few, then the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377662	392	00:16:19.11	00:16:20.95	decision may not be reliable.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377662	393	00:16:20.95	00:16:24.11	So on the one hand we want to find more
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377663	394	00:16:24.11	00:16:24.94	neighbors right?
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377663	395	00:16:24.94	00:16:27.22	And then we have more votes, but on the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377663	396	00:16:27.22	00:16:29.483333	other hand as we try to find the more
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377664	397	00:16:29.483333	00:16:32.07	neighbors, we actually could risk on
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377664	398	00:16:32.07	00:16:33.93	getting neighbors that are not.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:30:10.573514	399	00:16:33.98	00:16:37.08	really similar to this instance, they

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377666	401	00:16:38.97	00:16:40.756666	to get more neighbors, so although you
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377666	402	00:16:40.756666	00:16:42.29	get more labels to vote, but those
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:30:21.567307	402	00:16:40.756666	00:16:42.29	get more neighbors to vote, but those

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377667	404	00:16:45.01	00:16:46.52	because they are not very similar to
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377668	405	00:16:46.52	00:16:47.27	the object.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377669	407	00:16:50.43	00:16:53.11	empirically and typically you can
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377669	408	00:16:53.11	00:16:54.76	optimize such a parameter by using
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37767	409	00:16:54.76	00:16:56.09	cross validation.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37767	410	00:16:56.09	00:16:57.55	Basically, you're going to separate
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377671	411	00:16:57.55	00:17:01.16	your training data into two parts and

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377672	413	00:17:03.58	00:17:05.06	actually help you choose.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377672	414	00:17:05.27	00:17:05.95	The.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377672	415	00:17:06.74	00:17:09	The printer K here or some other
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:30:47.223928	415	00:17:06.74	00:17:09	The parameter K here or some other
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377673	416	00:17:09	00:17:11.08	parameters in other classifiers, and
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377673	417	00:17:11.08	00:17:13.87	then you're good to assume this number
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-08 06:39:16.926157	417	00:17:11.08	00:17:13.87	then you're going to assume this number
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377674	418	00:17:13.87	00:17:15.55	that works well on your training set
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377674	419	00:17:15.55	00:17:20.05	would be actually the best for your
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377675	420	00:17:20.05	00:17:20.86	future data.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377675	421	00:17:23.16	00:17:25.5	So as I mentioned that Cayanan can be
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:31:03.847743	421	00:17:23.16	00:17:25.5	So as I mentioned that KNN can be
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377676	422	00:17:25.5	00:17:28.16	actually regarded as estimate of
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377677	423	00:17:28.16	00:17:30.09	conditional probability of Y given X,

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377678	425	00:17:31.61	00:17:33.75	category of discriminative approaches.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:31:16.555742	426	00:17:34.46	00:17:36.79	So the key assumption that we made
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377679	427	00:17:36.79	00:17:38.56	in this approach is that the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377679	428	00:17:38.56	00:17:41.083333	distribution of the label given the

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:31:25.793774	431	00:17:44.85	00:17:47.63	For example, probability of theta I
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377681	432	00:17:47.63	00:17:51.94	given document D is local smooth and
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:31:37.51887	432	00:17:47.63	00:17:51.94	given document D is locally smoothed and

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377682	434	00:17:53.966666	00:17:56.85	that this probability is the same for
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377682	435	00:17:56.85	00:17:59.12	all the documents in this region.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377683	436	00:17:59.12	00:18:00.76	I are here.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377683	437	00:18:01.44	00:18:03.29	And suppose we draw a neighborhood and
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377684	438	00:18:03.29	00:18:04.925	we're going to assume in this

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377685	440	00:18:06.7025	00:18:08.835	instances are very similar, we're going
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:31:56.909986	440	00:18:06.7025	00:18:08.835	 are very similar, we're going
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377685	441	00:18:08.835	00:18:11.13	to assume that the conditional
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377686	442	00:18:11.13	00:18:13.066	distribution of the label, given the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377686	443	00:18:13.066	00:18:15	data, would be roughly the same.
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377686	444	00:18:15	00:18:17.45	If D is not different, very different
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377687	445	00:18:17.45	00:18:19.859999	than we're going to assume that the
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377688	446	00:18:19.86	00:18:22.24	probability of Cedar given D would be
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-12-07 19:32:10.547372	446	00:18:19.86	00:18:22.24	probability of theta given D would be
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377688	447	00:18:22.24	00:18:24.43	also similar, and so that's a very key
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377689	448	00:18:24.43	00:18:26.59	assumption, and that that's.

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377689	450	00:18:29.87	00:18:32.29	that would allow us to do a lot of

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.37769	452	00:18:34.39	00:18:36.14	whether this is true of course would

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377696	466	00:19:01.6	00:19:03.42	Then what we are saying is that in
4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377697	467	00:19:03.42	00:19:05.9925	order to estimate the probability of

4da6283d-6903-4be9-8bfc-ad5d330343c6	2020-11-02 23:08:52.377698	472	00:19:17.01	00:19:18.82	bringing additional data points to help

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660049	73	00:02:49.46	00:02:51.95	data to estimate parameters, and this
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660049	74	00:02:51.95	00:02:53.3	is precisely what will happen.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66005	75	00:02:54.16	00:02:57.28	So in this case we can use maximum a
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66005	76	00:02:57.28	00:03:00.4875	posteriori estimate, also called map
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660051	77	00:03:00.4875	00:03:02.59	estimate, and the formula is given
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660051	78	00:03:02.59	00:03:02.82	here.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660051	79	00:03:02.82	00:03:04.63	Basically is to maximize the posterior
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660052	80	00:03:04.63	00:03:06.94	distribution probability and this is a
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660052	81	00:03:06.94	00:03:09.313333	combination of the likelihood of data
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660053	82	00:03:09.313333	00:03:10.458333	and the prior.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660053	83	00:03:10.458333	00:03:12.24	So what would happen is that we're
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660053	84	00:03:12.24	00:03:14.766	going to have estimated that listens to
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:22:17.915708	84	00:03:12.24	00:03:14.766	going to have an estimate that listens to
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660054	85	00:03:14.766	00:03:18.01	the data and also listens to our prior
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660054	86	00:03:18.01	00:03:19.01	preferences.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660054	87	00:03:19.01	00:03:21.57	We can use this prior, which is denoted
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660055	88	00:03:21.57	00:03:24.33	as P of Lambda to encode.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660055	89	00:03:24.38	00:03:26.94	All kinds of preferences and
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660056	90	00:03:26.94	00:03:27.7	constraints.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660056	91	00:03:27.7	00:03:30.83	So for example, we can use this to
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660057	92	00:03:30.83	00:03:34.72	encode the need of having precise 1
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:22:34.209441	92	00:03:30.83	00:03:34.72	encode the need of having precisely 1
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660057	93	00:03:34.72	00:03:35.73	background the topic.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660058	94	00:03:36.34	00:03:39.559999	Now this can be included as a prior
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:22:43.732463	94	00:03:36.34	00:03:39.559999	Now this can be encoded as a prior
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660058	95	00:03:39.56	00:03:42.82	because we can say the prior for the
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660059	96	00:03:42.82	00:03:47.469999	parameters is only a non zero if the
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660059	97	00:03:47.47	00:03:50.26	plan does contain one topic that's
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660059	98	00:03:50.26	00:03:52.2525	equivalent to the background language
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66006	99	00:03:52.2525	00:03:52.595	model.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66006	100	00:03:52.595	00:03:55.48	In other words, in other cases if it's
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66006	101	00:03:55.48	00:03:56.909999	not like that, we're going to say
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660061	102	00:03:56.91	00:03:59.21	supplier says it's impossible.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660061	103	00:03:59.21	00:04:02.065	So the probability of that kind of
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660062	104	00:04:02.065	00:04:05.04	model setting would be 0 according to
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660062	105	00:04:05.04	00:04:05.79	our prior.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660063	106	00:04:07.92	00:04:11.59	So now we can also, for example use the
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660063	107	00:04:11.59	00:04:15.34	prior to force particular choice of

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660064	110	00:04:19.24	00:04:21.55	For example, we can force the document
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660065	111	00:04:21.55	00:04:24.51	D to choose topical one with
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:23:34.159127	111	00:04:21.55	00:04:24.51	D to choose topic one with
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660065	112	00:04:24.51	00:04:26.949999	probability of 1/2.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660065	113	00:04:27.5	00:04:31.42	Or we can prevent a topic from being
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660066	114	00:04:31.42	00:04:33.109999	used in generated document.

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660066	116	00:04:34.95	00:04:36.256666	not be user generated.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660067	117	00:04:36.256666	00:04:39.11	Document D will set to the Pi value to

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660068	120	00:04:44.08	00:04:46.21	of parameters with topics that assign

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660069	124	00:04:50.04	00:04:51.55	it's impossible, but we're going to
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66007	125	00:04:51.55	00:04:53.83	just strong in favor certain kind of

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660071	128	00:04:57.18	00:05:00.13	The map can be computed using a similar

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660074	135	00:05:12.82	00:05:14.81	special form of the prior called
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660074	136	00:05:14.81	00:05:17.506666	conjugate prior, then the functional
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660074	137	00:05:17.506666	00:05:19.628	form of the prior will be similar to
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660075	138	00:05:19.628	00:05:20.104	the data.

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660075	140	00:05:22.8125	00:05:26.57	the consequences that you can basically

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660077	147	00:05:40.29	00:05:40.71	data.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660078	148	00:05:41.16	00:05:44.39	And this is convenient for computation.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660078	149	00:05:44.39	00:05:46.87	It doesn't mean conjugate prior is the

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660079	152	00:05:52.38	00:05:52.85	example.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66008	153	00:05:52.85	00:05:55.5	Suppose the user is particularly
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66008	154	00:05:55.5	00:05:57.46	interested in battery life of a laptop,
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66008	155	00:05:57.46	00:05:59.1	and we're analyzing reviews.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66008	156	00:05:59.1	00:06:02.17	So the prior says that the distribution
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660081	157	00:06:02.17	00:06:04.79	should contain one distribution that
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660081	158	00:06:04.79	00:06:06.93	would assign high probabilities, tool,
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:25:03.991781	158	00:06:04.79	00:06:06.93	would assign high probabilities to
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660081	159	00:06:06.93	00:06:08.659999	battery, and life.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660082	160	00:06:09.47	00:06:12.14	So we could do say there's a
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660082	161	00:06:12.14	00:06:14.15	distribution that's entirely
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660082	162	00:06:14.15	00:06:16.28	concentrated on battery life and we all

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660083	164	00:06:18.53	00:06:20.549999	should be very similar to this.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660083	165	00:06:20.55	00:06:23.79	Now if we use map estimate with the

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660084	167	00:06:27.208	00:06:30.77	prior Dirichlet distribution based on
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660084	168	00:06:30.77	00:06:33.84	this preference, then the only

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660085	172	00:06:38.535	00:06:40.16	we are going to add.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660085	173	00:06:40.22	00:06:44.65	Additional counts to reflect our prior
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660086	174	00:06:44.65	00:06:44.97	right.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-04 08:28:49.307958	174	00:06:44.65	00:06:44.97	right?
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660086	175	00:06:44.97	00:06:49.119999	So here you can see the pseudocounts
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660086	176	00:06:49.12	00:06:52.083333	are defined the based on the

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660102	217	00:08:23.24	00:08:24.806666	Now cancel the picture.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:27:17.106864	217	00:08:23.24	00:08:24.806666	Now can you picture.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660102	218	00:08:24.806666	00:08:26.82	Think about what would happen if we set
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660103	219	00:08:26.82	00:08:27.59	Muta Zero.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-04 08:30:07.107427	219	00:08:26.82	00:08:27.59	Mu to Zero.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660103	220	00:08:27.59	00:08:29.975	Well, that's essentially to remove this
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660104	221	00:08:29.975	00:08:32.9	prior, so mu in some sense indicates
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660104	222	00:08:32.9	00:08:34.51	our strength on prior.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660104	223	00:08:35.18	00:08:37.35	Now what would happen if we set Mewtwo
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-04 08:30:15.878016	223	00:08:35.18	00:08:37.35	Now what would happen if we set Mu to
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660105	224	00:08:37.35	00:08:38.86	positive Infinity?
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660105	225	00:08:38.86	00:08:41.22	Well, that's to say this price is so
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660105	226	00:08:41.22	00:08:42.69	strong that we're not going to listen
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660106	227	00:08:42.69	00:08:43.85	to the data at all.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660106	228	00:08:43.85	00:08:46.76	So in the end you can see in this case
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660107	229	00:08:46.76	00:08:49.66	we can do make one distribution fixed
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660107	230	00:08:49.66	00:08:50.73	to the prior.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660107	231	00:08:50.73	00:08:52.09	You see why?
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660108	232	00:08:52.09	00:08:55.853333	When view is Infinity, we basically let
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:27:41.141756	232	00:08:52.09	00:08:55.853333	When mu is Infinity, we basically let
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660108	233	00:08:55.853333	00:08:57.34	this one dominate.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660108	234	00:08:57.34	00:09:00.059999	In fact, we can do set this one.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:28:00.299642	234	00:08:57.34	00:09:00.059999	In fact, we are going to set this one.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660109	235	00:09:00.65	00:09:04.302	Two precise this distribution, so in
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:28:15.329021	235	00:09:00.65	00:09:04.302	to precise this distribution, so in
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660109	236	00:09:04.302	00:09:07.2	this case it is this distribution, and
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66011	237	00:09:07.2	00:09:09.33	that's why we said the background
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66011	238	00:09:09.33	00:09:11.06	language model is in fact a way to
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.66011	239	00:09:11.06	00:09:13.46	improve supplier, because with false
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:28:36.154356	239	00:09:11.06	00:09:13.46	enforce a prior, because with false
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:28:50.863161	239	00:09:11.06	00:09:13.46	enforce a prior, because we force
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660111	240	00:09:13.46	00:09:16.3	one distribution to be exactly the same
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660111	241	00:09:16.3	00:09:19.076666	as what we give that the background
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-12-14 08:29:01.363729	241	00:09:16.3	00:09:19.076666	as what we give, that's the background
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660111	242	00:09:19.076666	00:09:19.412222	distribution.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660112	243	00:09:19.412222	00:09:22.906666	So in this case we can even force the
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660112	244	00:09:22.906666	00:09:25.22	distribution to entirely focused on
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660112	245	00:09:25.22	00:09:25.99	battery life.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660113	246	00:09:25.99	00:09:27.76	But of course this won't work well
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660113	247	00:09:27.76	00:09:29.815	'cause it cannot attract other words,
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660113	248	00:09:29.815	00:09:31.53	it would affect the accuracy of
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660114	249	00:09:31.53	00:09:32.27	counting.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660114	250	00:09:32.32	00:09:34.55	Topics about the battery life so in
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660115	251	00:09:34.55	00:09:36.61	practice mule is set somewhere in

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660115	252	00:09:36.61	00:09:37.56	between, of course.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660115	253	00:09:38.73	00:09:41.043333	So this is one way to impose our prior.
5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660116	254	00:09:41.043333	00:09:44.05	We can also impose some other

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660117	257	00:09:46.07	00:09:48.5075	for constant, including zero as needed.

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660118	259	00:09:51.52	00:09:53.06	the piles to 0.

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660118	261	00:09:57.78	00:10:00.24	topic to participate in generating that

5190e288-54f7-4021-9083-8e8ceac11345	2020-11-02 23:02:33.660121	264	00:10:02.81	00:10:05.475	when we have prior knowledge E.

51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45947	41	00:01:45.65	00:01:48.36	look at the scenario we had before

51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459508	76	00:03:14.22	00:03:16.683333	And of course, we can also define this
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459508	77	00:03:16.683333	00:03:18.4	conditional entropy for the scenario
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459509	78	00:03:18.4	00:03:20.17	where we don't see each.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 22:57:14.02211	78	00:03:18.4	00:03:20.17	where we don't see eats.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459509	79	00:03:20.17	00:03:22.91	So if we know it's did not occur in the
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 22:57:21.873507	79	00:03:20.17	00:03:22.91	So if we know eats did not occur in the
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459509	80	00:03:22.91	00:03:25.28	segment, then this end conditional
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 22:57:33.001438	80	00:03:22.91	00:03:25.28	segment, then this conditional
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459509	81	00:03:25.28	00:03:27.76	entropy would capture the uncertainty
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45951	82	00:03:27.76	00:03:30.47	of meat in that content in that
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45951	83	00:03:30.47	00:03:30.92	condition.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45951	84	00:03:31.75	00:03:33.68	So now putting different scenarios
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45951	85	00:03:33.68	00:03:35.29	together, we have the complete
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459511	86	00:03:35.29	00:03:37.1	definition of conditional entropy as
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459511	87	00:03:37.1	00:03:37.69	follows.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459511	88	00:03:39.13	00:03:40.03	Basically.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459511	89	00:03:40.7	00:03:43.56	We're going to consider both scenarios
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459512	90	00:03:43.56	00:03:48.375714	of the value of eats zero or one, and
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459512	91	00:03:48.375714	00:03:51.123333	this gives us the probability that eats
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459512	92	00:03:51.123333	00:03:54.06	is equal to 01.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 22:57:58.916513	92	00:03:51.123333	00:03:54.06	is equal to 0 or 1.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459512	93	00:03:54.06	00:03:56.67	Basically, whether it is present or
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 22:58:06.182123	93	00:03:54.06	00:03:56.67	Basically, whether eats is present or
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459512	94	00:03:56.67	00:03:59.896666	absent, and this of course is the
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459513	95	00:03:59.896666	00:04:02.935	entropy conditional entropy of meat in
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459513	96	00:04:02.935	00:04:04.53	that particular scenario.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459513	97	00:04:05.35	00:04:11.45	So if you expand this entropy, then you
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459513	98	00:04:11.45	00:04:14.42	have the following equation.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459514	99	00:04:15.62	00:04:18.1	Where you see the involvement of those
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459525	100	00:04:18.1	00:04:19.47	conditional probabilities.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459526	101	00:04:21.4	00:04:24.12	Now in general, for any discrete random
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459526	102	00:04:24.12	00:04:26.48	variables X&Y we have.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459526	103	00:04:27.78	00:04:31.25	The conditional entropy is no larger
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459527	104	00:04:31.25	00:04:35.61	than the entropy of the variable X, so
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459527	105	00:04:35.61	00:04:39.9725	basically this is upper bound for the
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459539	106	00:04:39.9725	00:04:41.4375	conditional entropy.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459548	107	00:04:41.4375	00:04:44.99	That means by knowing more information
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459548	108	00:04:44.99	00:04:48.1	about the segment, we won't be able to
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459548	109	00:04:48.1	00:04:49.433333	increase the uncertainty.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459549	110	00:04:49.433333	00:04:51.62	We can only reduce uncertainty, and
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459549	111	00:04:51.62	00:04:54.14	that intuitively makes sense because as
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459549	112	00:04:54.14	00:04:56.57	we know more information, it should
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459549	113	00:04:56.57	00:04:57.81	always help us.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45955	114	00:04:58.03	00:05:01.66	Make the prediction and he cannot hurt
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 22:59:08.511518	114	00:04:58.03	00:05:01.66	Make the prediction and it cannot hurt
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45955	115	00:05:01.66	00:05:03.84	the prediction in any case.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45955	116	00:05:05.3	00:05:07.04	Now what's interesting here is also to
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45955	117	00:05:07.04	00:05:08.973333	think about what's the minimum possible
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459551	118	00:05:08.973333	00:05:11.31	value of this conditional entropy.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459551	119	00:05:11.31	00:05:14.494	Now we know that the maximum value is
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459551	120	00:05:14.494	00:05:16.37	the entropy of X.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459551	121	00:05:17.79	00:05:19.3	But what about the minimum?
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459552	122	00:05:19.3	00:05:20.52	So what do you think?
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459552	123	00:05:22.76	00:05:24.61	I hope you can reach the conclusion
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459552	124	00:05:24.61	00:05:27.945	that the minimum possible value would
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459552	125	00:05:27.945	00:05:29.68	be 0 and it will be interesting to
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459553	126	00:05:29.68	00:05:32.28	think about and what situation will
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 22:59:40.356725	126	00:05:29.68	00:05:32.28	think about and in what situation will
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459553	127	00:05:32.28	00:05:33.14	achieve this.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459553	128	00:05:33.98	00:05:36.12	So let's see how we can use conditional
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459553	129	00:05:36.12	00:05:37.57	entropy to capture syntagmatic
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459553	130	00:05:37.57	00:05:38.39	relations.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459554	131	00:05:39.27	00:05:42.97	Now, of course this conditional entropy
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459554	132	00:05:42.97	00:05:45.47	gives us directly one way to measure
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459554	133	00:05:45.47	00:05:47.41	the Association of two words.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 22:59:51.690761	133	00:05:45.47	00:05:47.41	the association of two words.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459555	134	00:05:48.17	00:05:52.15	Because it tells us to what extend we
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:00:06.857193	134	00:05:48.17	00:05:52.15	Because it tells us to what extent we
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459555	135	00:05:52.15	00:05:54.92	can predict the one word given that we
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459555	136	00:05:54.92	00:05:57.14	know the presence or absence of another
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459555	137	00:05:57.14	00:05:57.56	word.

51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459556	139	00:06:01.743333	00:06:03.89	conditional entropy in capturing
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459556	140	00:06:03.89	00:06:06.08	syntagmatic relations, it's useful to
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459556	141	00:06:06.08	00:06:08.21	think of a very special case listed
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459557	142	00:06:08.21	00:06:12.568	here, that is, the conditional entropy
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459557	143	00:06:12.568	00:06:13.4	of.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:00:27.510738	143	00:06:12.568	00:06:13.4	of
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459557	144	00:06:14.16	00:06:17.38	The word given itself.

51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459607	247	00:10:56.52	00:10:59.73	But if we think about the two pairs
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459607	248	00:10:59.73	00:11:03.773333	where we share W2 in the same condition
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459607	249	00:11:03.773333	00:11:07.99	and we try to predict the WR&W 3, then
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:11:35.905438	249	00:11:03.773333	00:11:07.99	and we try to predict the W1&W3, then
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459607	250	00:11:07.99	00:11:09.96	the end conditional entropies are
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:11:46.22523	250	00:11:07.99	00:11:09.96	the conditional entropies are
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459608	251	00:11:09.96	00:11:11.765	actually not comperable well.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:12:03.731455	251	00:11:09.96	00:11:11.765	actually not comperable.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459608	252	00:11:11.765	00:11:15.485714	And you can think about this question,
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459608	253	00:11:15.485714	00:11:16.597142	why so?
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:12:15.352915	253	00:11:15.485714	00:11:16.597142	why?
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459608	254	00:11:16.597142	00:11:19.49	Why are they not comfortable?
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:12:18.876991	254	00:11:16.597142	00:11:19.49	So Why are they not comfortable?
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:12:23.959794	254	00:11:16.597142	00:11:19.49	So Why are they not comparable?
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459608	255	00:11:19.49	00:11:21.55	Well, that was 'cause they have a
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:12:36.856329	255	00:11:19.49	00:11:21.55	Well, that was because they have a
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459609	256	00:11:21.55	00:11:23.45	different upper bounds, right?
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459609	257	00:11:23.45	00:11:25.54	So those upper bounds are precisely the
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459609	258	00:11:25.54	00:11:26.94	entropy of WR.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:12:46.891524	258	00:11:25.54	00:11:26.94	entropy of W1
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459609	259	00:11:27.01	00:11:28.396666	And the entropy of W.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:12:53.300819	259	00:11:27.01	00:11:28.396666	and the entropy of W3.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459609	260	00:11:28.396666	00:11:30.67	3 and they have different upper bounds,
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:13:01.736625	260	00:11:28.396666	00:11:30.67	And they have different upper bounds,
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45961	261	00:11:30.67	00:11:33.84	so we cannot really compare them in
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45961	262	00:11:33.84	00:11:34.47	this way.
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45961	263	00:11:34.47	00:11:36.63	So how do we address this problem?
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.45961	264	00:11:37.87	00:11:42.04	Later with discuss we can use mutual
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-27 23:13:14.448219	264	00:11:37.87	00:11:42.04	Later we'll discuss we can use mutual
51be74e8-eb10-47c2-a768-b688605de1e0	2020-11-02 22:57:07.459611	265	00:11:42.04	00:11:44.34	information to solve this problem.
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202123	1	00:00:00.3	00:00:02.545	Now let's look at the another behavior
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202123	2	00:00:02.545	00:00:05.3875	of mixture model and in this case let's
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202124	3	00:00:05.3875	00:00:07.26	look at their response to the data
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202124	4	00:00:07.26	00:00:08.26	frequencies.
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202125	5	00:00:08.26	00:00:11.11	OK, So what you're seeing now is
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202125	6	00:00:11.11	00:00:12.72	basically the likelihood function for
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202126	7	00:00:12.72	00:00:15.19	the two Word document, and we know in
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-12-01 04:20:11.394709	7	00:00:12.72	00:00:15.19	the two word document, and we know in
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202126	8	00:00:15.19	00:00:17.62	this case the solution is to give text
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202127	9	00:00:17.62	00:00:20.42	a probability of .9 and the probability

5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202128	12	00:00:32.01	00:00:34.39	scenario where we start adding more
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202129	13	00:00:34.39	00:00:35.68	words to the document.
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202129	14	00:00:35.68	00:00:38.44	So what would happen if we add mini
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-12-01 04:20:34.698999	14	00:00:35.68	00:00:38.44	So what would happen if we add many
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.20213	15	00:00:38.44	00:00:39.53	this to the document?
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-12-08 04:14:19.680058	15	00:00:38.44	00:00:39.53	the's to the document?
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.20213	16	00:00:41.23	00:00:43.6	Now this will change the game, right?
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.20213	17	00:00:44.27	00:00:46.69	So how picture?

5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202131	18	00:00:46.69	00:00:49.15	What would the likelihood function look
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-12-01 04:21:05.02486	18	00:00:46.69	00:00:49.15	what would the likelihood function look

5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202133	22	00:00:54.19	00:00:56.46	As we add more words, we know that, but
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-12-01 04:21:19.757898	22	00:00:54.19	00:00:56.46	As we add more words, we know that,

5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202134	24	00:00:58.44	00:01:00.68	function by additional terms to account

5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202135	27	00:01:05.25	00:01:07.355	terms are there, we're going to just
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-12-01 04:21:31.282797	27	00:01:05.25	00:01:07.355	terms are the, we're going to just

5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-12-01 04:22:05.079629	32	00:01:16.9	00:01:20.51	term and so on, so forth until we add

5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202139	35	00:01:28.27	00:01:29.73	Now this obviously changes the
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.20214	36	00:01:29.73	00:01:31.129999	likelihood function, so what's
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.20214	37	00:01:31.13	00:01:33.51	interesting is now to think about how

5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202143	43	00:01:45.5	00:01:46.95	for this new function, right?
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202143	44	00:01:48.19	00:01:50.31	But the question is how should we
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202144	45	00:01:50.31	00:01:50.74	change it?
5350ccd0-beab-48fc-8484-d8e6a38c4cbf	2020-11-02 23:00:33.202144	46	00:01:50.74	00:01:52.51	Or in general there's something one.

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.72515	71	00:02:42.44	00:02:46.58	So in practice we will have to simplify
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725151	72	00:02:46.58	00:02:48.48	the model in some way.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725151	73	00:02:49.2	00:02:50.84	So the simplest language model is
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725152	74	00:02:50.84	00:02:52.66	called a unigram language model.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725152	75	00:02:52.66	00:02:56.55	In such a case, we simply assume that
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725153	76	00:02:56.55	00:03:00.24	text is generated by generating each

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725154	78	00:03:02.88	00:03:05.28	Now, in general, the words may not be
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725155	79	00:03:05.28	00:03:07.46	generated independently, but after we
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725156	80	00:03:07.46	00:03:08.79	make this assumption, we can
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725156	81	00:03:08.79	00:03:10.73	significantly simplify the language
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725157	82	00:03:10.73	00:03:11.17	model.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725157	83	00:03:12.14	00:03:13.77	Basically now the probability of a
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725158	84	00:03:13.77	00:03:16.33	sequence of words W sub one through
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:07:16.916111	84	00:03:13.77	00:03:16.33	sequence of words W _1 through
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:07:25.641801	84	00:03:13.77	00:03:16.33	sequence of words W_1 through

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:07:32.434649	85	00:03:16.33	00:03:19.075	W_n would be just a product of
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-12-10 20:40:05.216976	85	00:03:16.33	00:03:19.075	w_n would be just a product of
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725159	86	00:03:19.075	00:03:19.52	each.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.72516	87	00:03:19.52	00:03:21.74	The probability of each word.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.72516	88	00:03:24.74	00:03:27.27	So for such a model we have as many
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725161	89	00:03:27.27	00:03:29.51	parameters as the number of words in
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725162	90	00:03:29.51	00:03:30.43	our vocabulary.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725162	91	00:03:30.43	00:03:32.98625	So here we assume we have N words, so
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725163	92	00:03:32.98625	00:03:36.01	we have N probabilities, one for each
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725164	93	00:03:36.01	00:03:37.55	word, and there's something one.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:08:05.953945	93	00:03:36.01	00:03:37.55	word, and they sum to one.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725164	94	00:03:39.98	00:03:42.22	So now we can assume our text is a
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725165	95	00:03:42.22	00:03:44.74	sample drawn according to this world
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:08:15.771049	95	00:03:42.22	00:03:44.74	sample drawn according to this word
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725165	96	00:03:44.74	00:03:45.51	distribution.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725166	97	00:03:46.14	00:03:47.97	That just means we're gonna draw.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:08:21.482436	97	00:03:46.14	00:03:47.97	That just means we're gonna draw
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725166	98	00:03:49.39	00:03:51.44	Award each time and then eventually
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:08:24.777112	98	00:03:49.39	00:03:51.44	a ward each time and then eventually
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:51:31.840739	98	00:03:49.39	00:03:51.44	a word each time and then eventually
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725167	99	00:03:51.44	00:03:52.41	will get a text.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:08:38.664397	99	00:03:51.44	00:03:52.41	we'll get the text.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-12-10 20:40:59.587484	99	00:03:51.44	00:03:52.41	we'll get a text.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725167	100	00:03:53.61	00:03:55.97	So for example now again.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725168	101	00:03:57.69	00:04:00.5	We can try to sample words according to
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725168	102	00:04:00.5	00:04:01.4	a distribution.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725169	103	00:04:01.4	00:04:04.81	We might get Wednesday off or today
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-24 06:08:53.757122	103	00:04:01.4	00:04:04.81	We might get Wednesday often or today
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.72517	104	00:04:04.81	00:04:07.8	often and some other words like
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.72517	105	00:04:07.8	00:04:09.84	eigenvalue might have a small
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.72517	106	00:04:09.84	00:04:11.27	probability, etc.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725171	107	00:04:11.27	00:04:16.2	Now, with this we actually can also
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725171	108	00:04:16.2	00:04:19.76	compute the probability of every

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725172	110	00:04:22.68	00:04:25.07	specify the probabilities of words.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-12-10 20:41:35.175101	110	00:04:22.68	00:04:25.07	specifies the probabilities of words.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725173	111	00:04:25.87	00:04:27.7	This is because of the independence
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725173	112	00:04:27.7	00:04:28.88	assumption.

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725174	114	00:04:31.29	00:04:33.12	probability of today is Wednesday.

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725175	116	00:04:36.33	00:04:39.51	probability of today, probability of is
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725176	117	00:04:39.51	00:04:41.18	and probably Wednesday.
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725176	118	00:04:41.93	00:04:44.11	For example, I showed some fake numbers

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725177	120	00:04:46.16	00:04:47.92	numbers together to get the probability

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-12-10 20:42:05.615737	121	00:04:47.92	00:04:48.94	"of ""today is Wednesday""."

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.72518	123	00:04:52.39	00:04:55.3	probabilities, one for each word, we
54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725181	124	00:04:55.3	00:04:57.94	actually can characterize the

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725182	127	00:05:04.39	00:05:06.01	very simple model.

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725183	130	00:05:11.41	00:05:13.83	speech recognition, where you may care

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725184	133	00:05:17.945	00:05:19.71	for many tasks that involve.

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725199	162	00:06:26.31	00:06:28.66	about what is the probability of

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725205	176	00:07:00.96	00:07:03.479999	generate all kinds of text documents,

54ab232c-85cb-4829-abd0-6cbaed5f3fc8	2020-11-02 23:04:24.725215	201	00:07:53.01	00:07:54.91	assume that we have observed data.

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773647	20	00:00:49.675	00:00:51.56	function like a likelihood function.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773648	21	00:00:52.61	00:00:54.37	The whole process is driven by
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773648	22	00:00:54.37	00:00:56.75	optimizing the likeable, but here we
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773649	23	00:00:56.75	00:01:00.11	explicitly provide a review of what we
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773649	24	00:01:00.11	00:01:03.24	think are similar, and this is often
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77365	25	00:01:03.24	00:01:05.96	very useful because then it allows us
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77365	26	00:01:05.96	00:01:09.642	to inject any particular view of
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77365	27	00:01:09.642	00:01:12.1	similarity into the clustering program.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773651	28	00:01:12.1	00:01:14.06	So once we have a similarity function,
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773651	29	00:01:14.06	00:01:17.6	we can then aim at optimally

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773652	32	00:01:23.83	00:01:27.44	Anne, try to maximize the intragroup
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773653	33	00:01:27.44	00:01:30.64	similarity and minimize the intergroup
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773653	34	00:01:30.64	00:01:31.205	similarity.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773654	35	00:01:31.205	00:01:33.464	That is, to ensure the objects that are
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773654	36	00:01:33.464	00:01:36.08	put in the same group to be similar,
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773655	37	00:01:36.08	00:01:38.82	but the objects that are put into
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773655	38	00:01:38.82	00:01:41.9	different groups to be not similar, and
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773656	39	00:01:41.9	00:01:44.02	these are the general goals of
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773656	40	00:01:44.02	00:01:44.575	clustering.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773656	41	00:01:44.575	00:01:47.2	And there's often a tradeoff between
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773657	42	00:01:47.2	00:01:49.78	achieving both goals.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773657	43	00:01:49.78	00:01:51.72	Now, there are many different methods
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773658	44	00:01:51.72	00:01:54.34	for doing similarity based clustering.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773658	45	00:01:54.39	00:01:56.87	In general, I think we can distinguish
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773658	46	00:01:56.87	00:01:58.71	two strategies at high level.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773659	47	00:01:58.71	00:02:02.52	One is to progressively construct the
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773659	48	00:02:02.52	00:02:03.87	hierarchy of clusters.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77366	49	00:02:04.47	00:02:06.62	And so this often leads to hierarchical
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77366	50	00:02:06.62	00:02:10.06	clustering an we can further
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77366	51	00:02:10.06	00:02:12.21	distinguishes two ways to construct the
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773661	52	00:02:12.21	00:02:14.45	hierarchy depending on whether we
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773661	53	00:02:14.45	00:02:16.7	started with the collection to divide
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773661	54	00:02:16.7	00:02:19.58	the collection or start with individual
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773662	55	00:02:19.58	00:02:22.18	objects and gradually group them
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773662	56	00:02:22.18	00:02:22.575	together.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773662	57	00:02:22.575	00:02:24.96	So one is bottom up that can be called
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773663	58	00:02:24.96	00:02:27.95	agglomerative, where we gradually Group
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773663	59	00:02:27.95	00:02:29.91	A similar object into larger and larger
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773664	60	00:02:29.91	00:02:32.76	clusters until we group everything
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773664	61	00:02:32.76	00:02:33.24	together.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773665	62	00:02:33.83	00:02:35.95	The other is top down or divisive.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773665	63	00:02:35.95	00:02:37.925	In this case we gradually partitioning
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773666	64	00:02:37.925	00:02:40.425	the whole data set into smaller and
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773666	65	00:02:40.425	00:02:41.43	smaller clusters.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773667	66	00:02:41.43	00:02:44.16	The other general strategy is to start
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773667	67	00:02:44.16	00:02:45.953333	with the initial tentative clustering
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773667	68	00:02:45.953333	00:02:48.66	and then iteratively improve it and
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773668	69	00:02:48.66	00:02:51.44	this often leads to a flat clustering.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773668	70	00:02:51.44	00:02:53.95	One example is K means.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773668	71	00:02:54.61	00:02:56.36	So as I just said, there are many
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773669	72	00:02:56.36	00:02:58.58	different clustering methods available
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773669	73	00:02:58.58	00:02:59.21	and.

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77367	76	00:03:05.17	00:03:05.95	this course.

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773672	81	00:03:16.184	00:03:19.535	clustering or agency, the other is

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773674	84	00:03:22.1025	00:03:23.88	agglomerative hierarchical clustering.

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773675	86	00:03:27.12	00:03:29.12	similarity function calls to measure

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773675	88	00:03:31.02	00:03:33.25	we can gradually group similar objects
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773676	89	00:03:33.25	00:03:35.85	together in a bottom up profession to

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773676	91	00:03:38.94	00:03:40.91	also form a hierarchy and then we can

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773718	207	00:08:15.88	00:08:19.287142	just means two groups of two groups of
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773718	208	00:08:19.287142	00:08:22.15	people would be putting together as

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773734	256	00:10:10.99	00:10:11.95	in this case.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773734	257	00:10:14.47	00:10:17.05	Which is called K means clustering will
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773734	258	00:10:17.05	00:10:19.44	represent each text object as a term
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773735	259	00:10:19.44	00:10:22.27	vector and then assuming similarity
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773735	260	00:10:22.27	00:10:24.05	function defined onto objects.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773735	261	00:10:25.61	00:10:27.31	Now we're going to start with some
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773736	262	00:10:27.31	00:10:30.23	tentative clustering result by just
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773736	263	00:10:30.23	00:10:32.63	selecting Kate randomly selected
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773736	264	00:10:32.63	00:10:37.14	vectors as centroids of K clusters and
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773736	265	00:10:37.14	00:10:40.08	treat them as sentence as they
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773738	266	00:10:40.08	00:10:42.62	represent each cluster.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773739	267	00:10:43.29	00:10:44.01	So this is.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773739	268	00:10:44.01	00:10:45.86	This gives us the initial tentative
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773739	269	00:10:45.86	00:10:46.39	classroom.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77374	270	00:10:47.04	00:10:48.39	And then we're going to iteratively
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77374	271	00:10:48.39	00:10:50.59	improve it, and the process goes like
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77374	272	00:10:50.59	00:10:51.185	this.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773741	273	00:10:51.185	00:10:53.18	And once we have these Central
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773741	274	00:10:53.18	00:10:55.572	Eastside, we're going to assign a
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773741	275	00:10:55.572	00:10:59.69	vector to the cluster hosts entry that
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773741	276	00:10:59.69	00:11:03.47	is closest to the current vector.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773742	277	00:11:03.47	00:11:05.08	So basically we're going to measure the
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773742	278	00:11:05.08	00:11:07.45	distance between this vector and each
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773742	279	00:11:07.45	00:11:10.203333	of the centroids, and see which one is
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773742	280	00:11:10.203333	00:11:12.935	closest to this one, and then just put
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773743	281	00:11:12.935	00:11:16.09	this class this object into that
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773743	282	00:11:16.09	00:11:16.66	cluster.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773743	283	00:11:16.66	00:11:18.6	Now this is to have tentative.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773743	284	00:11:18.66	00:11:20.95	Assignment of objects into clusters and
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773744	285	00:11:20.95	00:11:23.365	we're going to partition or the objects
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773744	286	00:11:23.365	00:11:26.04	into K clusters based on our tentative
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773744	287	00:11:26.04	00:11:27.55	clustering centroids.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773744	288	00:11:28.51	00:11:30.6	And then we're going to recovery,
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773745	289	00:11:30.6	00:11:32.76	compute the centroid based on the
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773745	290	00:11:32.76	00:11:34.81	allocated objects in each cluster.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773745	291	00:11:35.46	00:11:36.6	And this is.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773746	292	00:11:37.2	00:11:40.27	To adjust the centroid and then we had
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773746	293	00:11:40.27	00:11:41.98	repeated this process until the
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773746	294	00:11:41.98	00:11:44.19	similarity based on objective function.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773747	295	00:11:44.19	00:11:47.325	In this case it's within cluster sum of
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773747	296	00:11:47.325	00:11:50.52	squares converges an theoretically we
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773747	297	00:11:50.52	00:11:53.64	can show that this process actually is
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773748	298	00:11:53.64	00:11:56.029999	going to minimize the within cluster
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773748	299	00:11:56.029999	00:11:58.676666	sum of squares where define objective

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773748	301	00:11:59.7	00:12:01.15	Given K clusters.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773749	302	00:12:01.98	00:12:04.439999	So it can be also shown this process
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773749	303	00:12:04.44	00:12:07.26	will converge to a local minimum.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773749	304	00:12:07.26	00:12:09.04	I think about this process for a
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77375	305	00:12:09.04	00:12:09.35	moment.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77375	306	00:12:09.35	00:12:11.91	It might remind you the EM algorithm
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77375	307	00:12:11.91	00:12:12.99	for mixture model.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77375	308	00:12:13.78	00:12:16.11	Indeed, this algorithm is very similar
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773751	309	00:12:16.11	00:12:19.06	to the EM algorithm for the mixture
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773751	310	00:12:19.06	00:12:20.23	model for clustering.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773751	311	00:12:20.23	00:12:22.26	So more specifically, we also
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773752	312	00:12:22.26	00:12:23.79	initialize these.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773752	313	00:12:24.83	00:12:28.34	Predators in the EM algorithm, so the
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773752	314	00:12:28.34	00:12:31.75	random inner inner initialization is
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773752	315	00:12:31.75	00:12:32.25	similar.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773753	316	00:12:34.08	00:12:36.08	And then in the EML with them, you may
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773753	317	00:12:36.08	00:12:37.97	recall that we're going to repeat
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773753	318	00:12:37.97	00:12:41.9	eastep and M step to improved our
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773754	319	00:12:41.9	00:12:42.865	primary destinations.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773754	320	00:12:42.865	00:12:45.34	In this case, we're going to improve
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773754	321	00:12:45.34	00:12:48.66	the clustering result iteratively by
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773755	322	00:12:48.66	00:12:52.163333	also doing 2 steps, and in fact the two
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773755	323	00:12:52.163333	00:12:55.07	steps are very similar to EM algorithm.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773755	324	00:12:55.63	00:12:59.62	In that when we allocate vector into
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773755	325	00:12:59.62	00:13:01.7	one of the clusters based on our
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773756	326	00:13:01.7	00:13:04.175	tentative clustering, it's very similar
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773756	327	00:13:04.175	00:13:06.48	to inferring the distribution that has
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773756	328	00:13:06.48	00:13:07.92	been used with generally the document
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773756	329	00:13:07.92	00:13:08.83	in the mixture model.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773757	330	00:13:08.83	00:13:11.28	So it's essentially similar to eastep.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773757	331	00:13:11.28	00:13:12.97	Also, what's the difference?
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773757	332	00:13:12.97	00:13:16.72	While the differences here, we don't
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773758	333	00:13:16.72	00:13:18.91	make a probabilistic on location as in

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773759	336	00:13:22.167777	00:13:25.96	We're going to make a call if this data

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.77376	339	00:13:31.09	00:13:32.67	So there's no choice, and we're not

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773761	343	00:13:38.86	00:13:40.36	probability, but we're going to just

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773763	350	00:13:52.83	00:13:56.46	which distribution has been used to

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773764	352	00:13:58.95	00:14:01.5	Now the next we're going to adjust the
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773764	353	00:14:01.5	00:14:03.69	centroid, and this is very similar to M
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773764	354	00:14:03.69	00:14:05.32	step where we re estimate the

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773766	358	00:14:10.02	00:14:12.43	So here we have a better clustering
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773766	359	00:14:12.43	00:14:15.1425	result by adjusting the centroid.
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773766	360	00:14:15.1425	00:14:17.43	And note that the central is adjusted
5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773767	361	00:14:17.43	00:14:21.22	based on the average of the vectors in

5bb813bd-6b7d-4f77-8156-21995f5944ad	2020-11-02 22:59:54.773768	364	00:14:24.555	00:14:27.6	the M step, where we do counts pull

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:41:09.667119	9	00:00:25.02	00:00:26.76	In this lecture, we're going to talk
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334952	10	00:00:26.76	00:00:28.93	about the generative models.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334952	11	00:00:29.58	00:00:31.6	In the next chapter, we're going to

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334953	14	00:00:36.86	00:00:38.946666	is actually very similar to document

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334954	19	00:00:46.97	00:00:48.99	we don't really know what other

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334955	20	00:00:48.99	00:00:51.006666	predefined categories or what are the
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334955	21	00:00:51.006666	00:00:51.443333	clusters.

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334956	23	00:00:54.44	00:00:55.17	clustering.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334956	24	00:00:55.17	00:00:58	We want to find such clusters in the
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334956	25	00:00:58	00:00:58.38	data.

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:41:39.848576	26	00:00:59.18	00:01:00.92	But in the case of categorization, we are
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334957	27	00:01:00.92	00:01:02.27	given the categories.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334957	28	00:01:02.27	00:01:05.2	So we kind of have predefined
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334958	29	00:01:05.2	00:01:06.64	categories and.

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-12-07 18:27:32.543503	30	00:01:07.22	00:01:09.359999	then based on these categories and
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334958	31	00:01:09.36	00:01:10.98	training data, we would like to
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334959	32	00:01:10.98	00:01:15.49	allocate a document to one of these
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334959	33	00:01:15.49	00:01:17.05	categories, or sometimes multiple

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.33496	36	00:01:20.4	00:01:22.96	two problems, we can actually adapt
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.334961	37	00:01:22.96	00:01:26.33	document clustering models for text

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335009	159	00:06:38.942	00:06:41.13	The account would be 0, so this time
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:49:11.15431	159	00:06:38.942	00:06:41.13	The count would be 0, so this time
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:49:14.287548	159	00:06:38.942	00:06:41.13	The count would be 0, so this count
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335009	160	00:06:41.13	00:06:42.4	we're just disappear.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:49:19.511498	160	00:06:41.13	00:06:42.4	would just be zero.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:49:37.291916	160	00:06:41.13	00:06:42.4	would just disappear.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.33501	161	00:06:42.4	00:06:45.18	So effectively we're just have the
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.33501	162	00:06:45.18	00:06:47.845	product over all the words in the
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.33501	163	00:06:47.845	00:06:48.2225	document.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335011	164	00:06:48.2225	00:06:50.3	So basically with naive Bayes
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335011	165	00:06:50.3	00:06:52.84	classifier, we're going to score each
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335012	166	00:06:52.84	00:06:55.26	category for a document by this
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335012	167	00:06:55.26	00:06:55.77	function.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335013	168	00:06:56.71	00:06:58.39	Now you may not set here.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:49:54.352718	168	00:06:56.71	00:06:58.39	Now you may notice that here
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335013	169	00:06:58.39	00:07:00.69	It involves the product of a lot of
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335013	170	00:07:00.69	00:07:05.14	small probabilities an this can cause
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:49:59.350608	170	00:07:00.69	00:07:05.14	small probabilities and this can cause
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335013	171	00:07:05.14	00:07:06.11	underflow problem.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335014	172	00:07:06.11	00:07:08.66	So one way to solve the problem is to
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335014	173	00:07:08.66	00:07:10.9	take logarithm of this function, which
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335015	174	00:07:10.9	00:07:12.74	doesn't change the order of these
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335015	175	00:07:12.74	00:07:15.02	categories, but would help us preserve
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335015	176	00:07:15.02	00:07:17.545384	precision and so this is often the.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335016	177	00:07:17.545384	00:07:19.84	This is often the function that we
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335016	178	00:07:19.84	00:07:23.07	actually use to score each category,
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335016	179	00:07:23.07	00:07:24.77	and then we're going to choose the
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335017	180	00:07:24.77	00:07:26.98	category that has highest.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:50:22.010479	180	00:07:24.77	00:07:26.98	category that has the highest
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335017	181	00:07:27.37	00:07:29.44	Score by this function.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:50:27.255769	181	00:07:27.37	00:07:29.44	score by this function.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335017	182	00:07:29.44	00:07:31.75	So this is called a naive based
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:50:36.424086	182	00:07:29.44	00:07:31.75	So this is called a Naiyes Bayes
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335018	183	00:07:31.75	00:07:32.51	classifier.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335018	184	00:07:32.51	00:07:35.28	Now the keyboard base is understandable
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:50:51.339894	184	00:07:32.51	00:07:35.28	Now the keyword Baayes is understandable
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-12-07 18:35:40.585845	184	00:07:32.51	00:07:35.28	Now the keyword Bayes is understandable
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335019	185	00:07:35.28	00:07:37.05	because we are applying a Bayes rule
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335019	186	00:07:37.05	00:07:37.54	here.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.33502	187	00:07:37.54	00:07:40.49	When we go from the posterior
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.33502	188	00:07:40.49	00:07:44.1	probability of the topic to a product
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.33502	189	00:07:44.1	00:07:46.38	of the likelihood and the prior.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335021	190	00:07:47.41	00:07:49.81	Now it's also called a naive cause.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:51:11.91041	190	00:07:47.41	00:07:49.81	Now it's also called a Naive because
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335021	191	00:07:49.81	00:07:51.76	We've made an assumption that every
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335022	192	00:07:51.76	00:07:53.64	word in the document is generated
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335022	193	00:07:53.64	00:07:56.685	independently, and this is indeed alive
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:51:25.466139	193	00:07:53.64	00:07:56.685	independently, and this is indeed a Naive

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335023	195	00:07:59.03	00:08:00.67	not generated in dependently.

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:51:39.455678	197	00:08:03.66	00:08:05.03	will more likely occur.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335025	198	00:08:05.03	00:08:07.88125	For example, if you have seen a word a
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:51:44.654163	198	00:08:05.03	00:08:07.88125	For example, if you have seen a word like a

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 01:51:49.468125	199	00:08:07.88125	00:08:10.05	text, then it makes categorisation or

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335027	203	00:08:16.84	00:08:19.61	simplify the problem, and it's actually
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335027	204	00:08:19.61	00:08:21.07	quite effective for many text

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335033	221	00:08:56.83	00:08:58.15	very simple case.

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335034	224	00:09:03.08	00:09:06.02	sure each state I actually represents

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335035	227	00:09:11.906666	00:09:14.82	category I or the word distributions

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335048	262	00:10:38.795	00:10:40.66	estimate these probabilities that I

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.33505	269	00:10:53.72	00:10:57.829999	indicates how popular each category is

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335052	274	00:11:07.39	00:11:09.85	words have high probabilities for each
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335053	275	00:11:09.85	00:11:10.39	category.

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335053	277	00:11:13.66	00:11:16.17	observed training data to estimate

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335054	279	00:11:18.69	00:11:20.86	And in general we can do this
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335054	280	00:11:20.86	00:11:23.37	separately for different categories.

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.33511	439	00:17:20.5	00:17:23.11	So we have to do smoothing to make sure
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335111	440	00:17:23.11	00:17:24.68	it's not zero probability.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335111	441	00:17:25.26	00:17:28.19	The other reason for smoothing is that
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335112	442	00:17:28.19	00:17:30.84	this is a way to bring prior knowledge,
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335112	443	00:17:30.84	00:17:33.1	and this is also generally true for a
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335113	444	00:17:33.1	00:17:35.07	lot of situations of smoothing.
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335113	445	00:17:35.07	00:17:37.2	When the data set is small, we tend to
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335114	446	00:17:37.2	00:17:39.379999	rely on some prior knowledge to.

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 02:18:00.631711	448	00:17:41.74	00:17:43.5	So in this case our prior knowledge is

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335116	449	00:17:43.5	00:17:45.4075	says that the number words should have
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-12-07 18:47:55.093923	449	00:17:43.5	00:17:45.4075	says that no words should have

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335117	451	00:17:47.74	00:17:50.54	us to inject the supplier to make sure

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335125	463	00:18:15.79	00:18:18.31	Well in general we added pseudocounts

6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-02 23:17:20.335137	487	00:19:11.07	00:19:13.925	here, meaning that the larger data is
6962b043-7dd8-4050-bad0-bbdb13e2c302	2020-11-30 02:20:32.568988	487	00:19:11.07	00:19:13.925	here, meaning that the larger delta is

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772367	37	00:01:34.99	00:01:36.74	representation, where we represent each

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77238	94	00:03:53.95	00:03:55.82	some words we have very very small

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772381	97	00:04:00.01	00:04:02.69	words that are shared by these topics.

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:46:36.394744	116	00:04:38.736666	00:04:40.74	So with this representation is

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772387	118	00:04:42.35	00:04:43.32	mentioned earlier.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772387	119	00:04:43.32	00:04:45.887142	First, it now uses multiple words that
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772388	120	00:04:45.887142	00:04:48.233333	describe topic, so it allows us to
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772388	121	00:04:48.233333	00:04:50.62	describe fairly complicated topics.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772388	122	00:04:50.62	00:04:53.805	Second, it assigns weights to terms, so
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772388	123	00:04:53.805	00:04:55.74	now we can model several differences of

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772389	125	00:04:59.23	00:05:02.91	together to model topic third.

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:28:25.589153	126	00:05:03.18	00:05:05.46	because we have probabilities for the
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772389	127	00:05:05.46	00:05:07.575	same world in different topics.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:28:31.146103	127	00:05:05.46	00:05:07.575	same word in different topics.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772389	128	00:05:07.575	00:05:11.595	We can disambiguate the sense of world
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:47:08.202258	128	00:05:07.575	00:05:11.595	We can disambiguate the sense of word
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772389	129	00:05:11.595	00:05:15.72	in the text to decode its underlying
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77239	130	00:05:15.72	00:05:18.43	topic, so we address all these three
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77239	131	00:05:18.43	00:05:20.86	problems with this new way of
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77239	132	00:05:20.86	00:05:22.246666	representing a topic.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77239	133	00:05:22.246666	00:05:24.11	So now, of course, our problem
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772391	134	00:05:24.11	00:05:26.98	definition has been refined just

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772391	136	00:05:27.57	00:05:29.665	The slide is very similar to what you
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772391	137	00:05:29.665	00:05:31.969999	have seen before, except that we have
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772391	138	00:05:31.97	00:05:33.47	added refinement for.

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772392	139	00:05:33.54	00:05:34.6	What the topic is.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:29:28.688143	139	00:05:33.54	00:05:34.6	what the topic is.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772392	140	00:05:34.6	00:05:37.13	So now each topic is world
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:29:35.756888	140	00:05:34.6	00:05:37.13	So now each topic is word
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772392	141	00:05:37.13	00:05:37.88	distribution.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772393	142	00:05:38.85	00:05:41.22	And for each word distribution, we know
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772393	143	00:05:41.22	00:05:43.05	that all the probabilities should
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772393	144	00:05:43.05	00:05:44.77	someone over all the words in the

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772394	147	00:05:47.87	00:05:50.32	still have another constraint on the
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772394	148	00:05:50.32	00:05:52.5475	topic coverage, namely pies.

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:47:51.452924	149	00:05:52.5475	00:05:56.77	So all the pis of IGS must sum to one

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772395	150	00:05:56.77	00:05:58.35	for the same document.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772395	151	00:05:59.5	00:06:01.2	So how do we solve this problem?

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772404	191	00:07:33.65	00:07:36.57	very general idea, and it's a
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772404	192	00:07:36.57	00:07:39.18	principled way of using statistical

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772404	195	00:07:45.05	00:07:47.64	have seen before in order to show the
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772405	196	00:07:47.64	00:07:48.84	generation process.

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:51:37.716185	200	00:07:55.803333	00:07:58.866666	So we design a probabilistic model to
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772406	201	00:07:58.866666	00:08:01.37	model how the data are generated.

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772406	203	00:08:03.56	00:08:03.935	assumption.

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772407	206	00:08:09.79	00:08:11.661428	probability distribution of the data

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772409	213	00:08:25.175	00:08:27.945	In general, we control the behavior of

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772409	214	00:08:27.945	00:08:29.85	the probabilistic model, meaning that

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:34:44.79636	217	00:08:32.31	00:08:34.25	it will give some data points
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77241	218	00:08:34.25	00:08:36.74	higher probabilities than others.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77241	219	00:08:36.74	00:08:38.64	Now in this case, of course, for our
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77241	220	00:08:38.64	00:08:40.84	tax mining problem, or more precisely

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772411	222	00:08:43.06	00:08:44.01	following plans.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:53:12.151201	222	00:08:43.06	00:08:44.01	following parameters.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772411	223	00:08:44.01	00:08:45.445	First we have seen eyes.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:53:19.671048	223	00:08:44.01	00:08:45.445	First we have theta_i's
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:34:59.61342	223	00:08:44.01	00:08:45.445	First, we have theta_i's
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772411	224	00:08:45.445	00:08:48.9	Each is word distribution and then we
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:53:24.988099	224	00:08:45.445	00:08:48.9	Each is a word distribution and then we
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772412	225	00:08:48.9	00:08:51.83	have a set of pies for each document.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:53:32.702095	225	00:08:48.9	00:08:51.83	have a set of pi's for each document.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772412	226	00:08:51.83	00:08:54.375	And since we have end documents so we
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:53:41.755195	226	00:08:51.83	00:08:54.375	And since we have N documents so we
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772412	227	00:08:54.375	00:08:56.449999	have N sets of pies.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:35:10.833101	227	00:08:54.375	00:08:56.449999	have N sets of pis.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772412	228	00:08:57.41	00:09:00	And each set all the pile Pi values
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:53:58.793258	228	00:08:57.41	00:09:00	And each set of the pi values
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772412	229	00:09:00	00:09:00.84	will sum to one.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772413	230	00:09:00.84	00:09:05.605	So this is to say that we first pretend
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772413	231	00:09:05.605	00:09:07.57	we already have these word
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772413	232	00:09:07.57	00:09:10.77	distributions and coverage numbers, and
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772413	233	00:09:10.77	00:09:13.26	then we're going to see how we can
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772414	234	00:09:13.26	00:09:16.345	generate data by using such
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772414	235	00:09:16.345	00:09:17.09	distributions.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772414	236	00:09:17.78	00:09:20.72	So how do we model the data in this
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772414	237	00:09:20.72	00:09:21.64	way?
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772414	238	00:09:21.64	00:09:24.02	And we assume that data are actually
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772415	239	00:09:24.02	00:09:27.93	samples drawn from such a model that
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772415	240	00:09:27.93	00:09:29.145	depends on these parameters.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772415	241	00:09:29.145	00:09:31.33	Now one interesting question here is to
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772415	242	00:09:31.33	00:09:34.33	think about how many parameters are
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772416	243	00:09:34.33	00:09:35.32	there in total.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772416	244	00:09:35.32	00:09:40.01	Now obviously we can already see N * K
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772416	245	00:09:40.01	00:09:41.905	parameters for pies.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:54:36.304514	245	00:09:40.01	00:09:41.905	parameters for pi's.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772416	246	00:09:41.905	00:09:45.935	We also see KC dies, but each seed I is
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-24 05:54:57.162547	246	00:09:41.905	00:09:45.935	We also see K theta_i's, but each theta_i is
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772416	247	00:09:45.935	00:09:48.5	actually a set of probability values.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772417	248	00:09:48.63	00:09:50.65	Right, it's a distribution over words.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:36:08.961068	248	00:09:48.63	00:09:50.65	Right? it's a distribution over words.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:36:14.393419	248	00:09:48.63	00:09:50.65	Right? It's a distribution over words.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772417	249	00:09:51.48	00:09:55.58	So I leave this as exercise for you to
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772417	250	00:09:55.58	00:09:58.16	figure out exactly how many parameters
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772417	251	00:09:58.16	00:09:58.98	there are here.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772417	252	00:09:59.83	00:10:01.88	Now, once we set up with a model, then
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772418	253	00:10:01.88	00:10:04.6	we can fit the model to our data,
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772418	254	00:10:04.6	00:10:07.215	meaning that we can estimate the
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772418	255	00:10:07.215	00:10:09.33	parameters or in further parameters
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:36:54.418042	255	00:10:07.215	00:10:09.33	parameters or infer the parameters
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772418	256	00:10:09.33	00:10:10.7625	based on the data.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772418	257	00:10:10.7625	00:10:13	In other words, we would like to adjust
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772419	258	00:10:13	00:10:16.33	these parameter values until we give
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772419	259	00:10:16.33	00:10:19.58	our data set the maximum probability.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772419	260	00:10:20.18	00:10:22.19	I just say that depending on the
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772419	261	00:10:22.19	00:10:23.84	parameter values, some data points will
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77242	262	00:10:23.84	00:10:26.2	have higher probabilities than others.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77242	263	00:10:26.2	00:10:29.3975	What we're interested in here is what
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77242	264	00:10:29.3975	00:10:32.16	parameter values will give our data set
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77242	265	00:10:32.16	00:10:33.4	the highest probability.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.77242	266	00:10:33.4	00:10:35.63	So I also illustrates the problem with
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:37:24.572349	266	00:10:33.4	00:10:35.63	So I also illustrate the problem with
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772421	267	00:10:35.63	00:10:38.29	the picture that you see here on the X
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:38:06.519585	267	00:10:35.63	00:10:38.29	the picture that you see here. On the X
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772421	268	00:10:38.29	00:10:38.64	axis.
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:37:49.163123	268	00:10:38.29	00:10:38.64	axis,
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772421	269	00:10:38.64	00:10:41.06	I just illustrate the Lambda the
6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-12-10 19:38:05.480686	269	00:10:38.64	00:10:41.06	I just illustrate the Lambda, the

6a9537c1-62fc-4f31-a8a7-bdfcad2f50eb	2020-11-02 23:15:15.772427	295	00:11:37.20875	00:11:39.37	We adjust the parameters to fit the

6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-25 18:24:13.961272	32	00:01:36.72	00:01:39.195	structures or natural groups well you,
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501059	33	00:01:39.195	00:01:43.11	if you look at it, you might agree that
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501059	34	00:01:43.11	00:01:46.59	we can group these objects based on
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50106	35	00:01:46.59	00:01:50.92	shapes or their locations on this 2
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501061	36	00:01:50.92	00:01:51.84	dimensional space.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501061	37	00:01:52.83	00:01:54.52	So we got the three clusters in this
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501062	38	00:01:54.52	00:01:54.95	case.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501062	39	00:01:56.85	00:01:59.64	And then may not be so much
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501063	40	00:01:59.64	00:02:01.99	disagreement about these three
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501063	41	00:02:01.99	00:02:04.41	clusters, but it really depends on the
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501064	42	00:02:04.41	00:02:06.26	perspective to look at the objects.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501064	43	00:02:07.54	00:02:10.53	Maybe some of you have also seen it in
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501065	44	00:02:10.53	00:02:12.09	a different way, so we might get
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501065	45	00:02:12.09	00:02:13.12	different clusters.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501066	46	00:02:13.96	00:02:18.3	Annual see another example about this
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-25 18:28:29.062384	46	00:02:13.96	00:02:18.3	And you will see another example about this
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501067	47	00:02:18.3	00:02:22.35	ambiguity more clearly, but the main
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501067	48	00:02:22.35	00:02:26.07	point here is the problem is actually
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501068	49	00:02:26.07	00:02:27.59	not so well defined.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501068	50	00:02:29.09	00:02:32.55	And the problem lies in how to define
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501069	51	00:02:32.55	00:02:34.02	similarity.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50107	52	00:02:34.02	00:02:36.3	What do you mean by similar objects?
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50107	53	00:02:38.02	00:02:39.45	Now this problem.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501071	54	00:02:40	00:02:42.54	Has to be clearly defined in order to
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501071	55	00:02:42.54	00:02:44.75	have well defined clustering problem.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501072	56	00:02:46.18	00:02:50.07	And the problem is in general that any
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501072	57	00:02:50.07	00:02:51.97	two objects can be seen that depending
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-25 18:29:02.065753	57	00:02:50.07	00:02:51.97	two objects can be similar that depending
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501073	58	00:02:51.97	00:02:53.02	on how you look at them.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501074	59	00:02:53.02	00:02:54.71	So for example.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501075	60	00:02:55.26	00:02:57.55	Let's look at the two words like car
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501075	61	00:02:57.55	00:02:58.26	and horse.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501076	62	00:03:00.1	00:03:03.24	I saw all the two words similar well.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-12-07 20:38:27.379426	62	00:03:00.1	00:03:03.24	So are the two words similar
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501076	63	00:03:04.52	00:03:06.76	It depends on how you look at it.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501077	64	00:03:06.76	00:03:09.16	If you look at the physical.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501078	65	00:03:10	00:03:13.5	Physical properties of Caran horse.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-25 18:29:19.655687	65	00:03:10	00:03:13.5	Physical properties of car and horse.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501078	66	00:03:13.5	00:03:14.84	They are very different.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501079	67	00:03:15.82	00:03:17.78	But if you look at the them
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501079	68	00:03:17.78	00:03:20.8	functionally, a car in the horse can
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50108	69	00:03:20.8	00:03:24.23	both be transportation tool, so in that
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501081	70	00:03:24.23	00:03:25.64	sense they may be similar.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501081	71	00:03:25.64	00:03:28.27	So as you can see, it really depends on
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501082	72	00:03:28.27	00:03:31.76	our perspective to look at the objects
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501083	73	00:03:31.76	00:03:35.66	and so in order to make the clustering
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501083	74	00:03:35.66	00:03:38.48	problem well defined, a user must
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501084	75	00:03:38.48	00:03:40.02	define the perspective.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501084	76	00:03:40.91	00:03:43.29	For assessing similarity.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501085	77	00:03:44.2	00:03:46.47	And we call this perspective the
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501086	78	00:03:46.47	00:03:47.66	clustering bias.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501086	79	00:03:49.15	00:03:51.96	And when you define a clustering
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501087	80	00:03:51.96	00:03:55.63	problem, it's important to specify your
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501087	81	00:03:55.63	00:03:59.22	perspective for similarity or for
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501087	82	00:03:59.22	00:04:03.06	defining the similarity that would be
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501088	83	00:04:03.06	00:04:06.05	used to group similar objects 'cause
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501089	84	00:04:06.05	00:04:06.93	otherwise.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501089	85	00:04:08.54	00:04:10.41	Similarity is not well defined.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50109	86	00:04:10.41	00:04:14.93	An one can have different ways to group
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50109	87	00:04:14.93	00:04:15.65	objects.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501091	88	00:04:16.76	00:04:18.65	So let's look at a concrete example.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501091	89	00:04:18.65	00:04:22.775	Here you are seeing some objects or
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501092	90	00:04:22.775	00:04:25.31	some shapes that are very similar to
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501092	91	00:04:25.31	00:04:27.94	what you have seen on the 1st slide.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501093	92	00:04:28.6	00:04:31.64	But if I ask you to group these objects
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501095	93	00:04:31.64	00:04:34	again, you might.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501096	94	00:04:36.57	00:04:37.14	Might.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501096	95	00:04:37.76	00:04:40.81	Feel there's more uncertainty here than
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501096	96	00:04:40.81	00:04:42.16	on the previous slide.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501097	97	00:04:42.75	00:04:43.99	For example.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501097	98	00:04:45.02	00:04:48.28	You might think, well, we can still
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501098	99	00:04:48.28	00:04:50.6	group by ships, so that would give us
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-25 18:30:23.193299	99	00:04:48.28	00:04:50.6	group by shapes, so that would give us
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501098	100	00:04:50.6	00:04:52.41	cluster that looks like this.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501098	101	00:04:53.4	00:04:56.62	However, you might also feel that.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501099	102	00:04:57.4	00:05:00.93	Maybe the objects can be grouped based
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501099	103	00:05:00.93	00:05:04.29	on the sizes, so that would give us a
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.5011	104	00:05:04.29	00:05:06.35	different way to cluster the data.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.5011	105	00:05:06.35	00:05:10.819999	If we look at the size and look at the
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.5011	106	00:05:10.82	00:05:12.06	similarity in size.

6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501102	108	00:05:15.2	00:05:16.79	depending on the perspective will get
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501102	109	00:05:16.79	00:05:19.68	different clustering results, so that
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501103	110	00:05:19.68	00:05:22.49	also clearly tells us that in order to
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501103	111	00:05:22.49	00:05:24.99	evaluate the clustering result we must
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501104	112	00:05:24.99	00:05:26.78	use perspective.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501104	113	00:05:26.78	00:05:29.11	Without perspective, it's very hard to
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501104	114	00:05:29.11	00:05:31.47	define what is the best clustering
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501105	115	00:05:31.47	00:05:32.07	result.

6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501106	117	00:05:38.39	00:05:39.04	clustering.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501106	118	00:05:40.46	00:05:41.17	Set up.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501107	119	00:05:42.14	00:05:44.87	And so, for example, we can cluster
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501107	120	00:05:44.87	00:05:47.23	documents in the heart Texas

6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501109	123	00:05:50.57	00:05:51.42	to be clustered.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501109	124	00:05:52.2	00:05:56.01	We may be able to cluster terms in this
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50111	125	00:05:56.01	00:05:56.29	case.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50111	126	00:05:56.29	00:05:57.63	Terms are objects.

6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-25 18:31:15.01528	127	00:05:58.2	00:06:00.17	And Cluster of terms can be used to
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501111	128	00:06:00.17	00:06:03.38	define the concept or theme or topic.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501112	129	00:06:03.38	00:06:05.22	In fact, the topic models that you have
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501112	130	00:06:05.22	00:06:07.35	seen some previous lectures.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501113	131	00:06:07.98	00:06:11.3	Can give you cluster of terms in some
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501113	132	00:06:11.3	00:06:11.68	sense.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501114	133	00:06:11.68	00:06:13.94	If you take the terms with high
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501114	134	00:06:13.94	00:06:17.72	probabilities from world distribution.

6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501115	136	00:06:21.77	00:06:24.61	any texts segments, for example
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501116	137	00:06:24.61	00:06:28.1	passages, sentences or any segments

6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501117	139	00:06:29.94	00:06:31.03	attacks objects.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-25 18:31:42.545084	139	00:06:29.94	00:06:31.03	text objects.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501117	140	00:06:32.01	00:06:34.345	For example, we might extract all the
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501118	141	00:06:34.345	00:06:36.52	text segments about the topic, let's
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501118	142	00:06:36.52	00:06:38.56	say by using a topic model.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501119	143	00:06:38.56	00:06:41.97	Now, once we've got those text objects,
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501119	144	00:06:41.97	00:06:46.01	then we can cluster.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501124	145	00:06:46.69	00:06:51.41	The segments that we've got to discover
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501124	146	00:06:51.41	00:06:54.57	interesting clusters that might also
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501125	147	00:06:54.57	00:06:55.82	represent the subtopics.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501125	148	00:06:56.82	00:06:59.21	So this is a case of combining text
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501125	149	00:06:59.21	00:07:00.79	clustering with some other techniques,
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501126	150	00:07:00.79	00:07:03.025	and in general you will see a lot of
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501126	151	00:07:03.025	00:07:05.87	text mining algorithms can be actually
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501127	152	00:07:05.87	00:07:09.35	combined in a flexible way to achieve.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501127	153	00:07:09.96	00:07:12.85	The goal of doing more sophisticated
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501128	154	00:07:12.85	00:07:15.04	mining and analysis of text data.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501128	155	00:07:15.95	00:07:18.6	We can also cluster fairly large tax
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-25 18:32:23.544886	155	00:07:15.95	00:07:18.6	We can also cluster fairly large text
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501129	156	00:07:18.6	00:07:21.34	law gets, and by that I just mean text
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501129	157	00:07:21.34	00:07:24.59	objects may contain a lot of documents.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50113	158	00:07:24.59	00:07:26.33	So for example we might cluster
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.50113	159	00:07:26.33	00:07:27.18	websites.

6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501131	161	00:07:29.25	00:07:30.29	multiple documents.
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501132	162	00:07:31.27	00:07:33.92	Similarly, we can also cluster articles
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501132	163	00:07:33.92	00:07:35.61	written by the same author, for
6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501133	164	00:07:35.61	00:07:36.17	example.

6a9b1334-5f53-407b-8864-2cff7edbc603	2020-11-02 23:18:04.501134	166	00:07:39.91	00:07:43.47	published by author as one unit for

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164922	83	00:03:36.78	00:03:40.97125	Here we can compare this with, let's
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164922	84	00:03:40.97125	00:03:44.89	say, value on the line.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164922	85	00:03:44.89	00:03:47.19	Let's say compare this with this point.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164922	86	00:03:48.32	00:03:51.72	They have identical X one, but then one
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164923	87	00:03:51.72	00:03:53.82	has a higher value for its too.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164923	88	00:03:54.59	00:03:57.59	Now let's look at the sign of the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164923	89	00:03:57.59	00:04:00.87	coefficient for X2, where we know this
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164923	90	00:04:00.87	00:04:01.75	is a positive.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164923	91	00:04:02.7	00:04:05.915714	So what that means is that the F value
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164923	92	00:04:05.915714	00:04:08.617142	for this point should be higher than
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164923	93	00:04:08.617142	00:04:12.29	the F value for this point on the line.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164924	94	00:04:12.29	00:04:14.14	That means this will be positive,
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164924	95	00:04:14.14	00:04:14.93	right?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164924	96	00:04:16.07	00:04:18.71	So we know in general for all the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164924	97	00:04:18.71	00:04:21.48	points on this side, the.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164924	98	00:04:22.51	00:04:24.11	Functions about it would be positive.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164924	99	00:04:24.87	00:04:27.15	And you can also verify all the points
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164924	100	00:04:27.15	00:04:29.68	on this side would be negative, and so
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164925	101	00:04:29.68	00:04:31.07	this is how this kind of linear
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164925	102	00:04:31.07	00:04:33.06	classifier or linear separator can then
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164925	103	00:04:33.06	00:04:35.2	separate the points in the two
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164925	104	00:04:35.2	00:04:35.95	categories.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164925	105	00:04:37.63	00:04:40.63	So now the natural question is, which
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164925	106	00:04:40.63	00:04:42.56	linear separate is the best?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164925	107	00:04:42.56	00:04:45.28	Now I've again she want lying here that
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164926	108	00:04:45.28	00:04:47.01	can separate the two classes.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164926	109	00:04:47.69	00:04:49.55	And this line, of course, is determined
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164926	110	00:04:49.55	00:04:52.45	by the vector beta, the coefficients,
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164926	111	00:04:52.45	00:04:54.56	different coefficient will give us a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164926	112	00:04:54.56	00:04:55.086666	different line.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164926	113	00:04:55.086666	00:04:56.55	So we could imagine there are other
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164926	114	00:04:56.55	00:04:58.175	lines that can do the same job.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164927	115	00:04:58.175	00:05:01.109999	So gamma, for example, could give us
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164927	116	00:05:01.11	00:05:03.335	another line that can also separate
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164927	117	00:05:03.335	00:05:04.89	these instances.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164927	118	00:05:05.76	00:05:07.48	And of course there are also lines that
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164927	119	00:05:07.48	00:05:09.15	won't separate them, and those are bad
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164927	120	00:05:09.15	00:05:09.52	lines.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164927	121	00:05:09.52	00:05:11.21	But the question is when we have
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164928	122	00:05:11.21	00:05:12.819999	multiple lines that can separate the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164928	123	00:05:12.82	00:05:15.62	both clauses, which line is the best?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164928	124	00:05:15.62	00:05:17.39	In fact, you can imagine there are many
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164928	125	00:05:17.39	00:05:19.58	different ways of choosing the line.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164928	126	00:05:20.8	00:05:23.93	So the logistical regression classifier
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164928	127	00:05:23.93	00:05:26.38	that you have seen earlier actually
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16493	128	00:05:26.38	00:05:29.85	uses some criteria to determine where
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16493	129	00:05:29.85	00:05:31.65	this line should be, and it's a linear
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16493	130	00:05:31.65	00:05:34.31	separate as well and uses a conditional
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16493	131	00:05:34.31	00:05:36.0575	likelihood on the training data to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16493	132	00:05:36.0575	00:05:37.88	determine which line is the best.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164931	133	00:05:37.88	00:05:39.9	But in this VM, we're going to look at
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164931	134	00:05:39.9	00:05:42.19	another criteria for determining which
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164931	135	00:05:42.19	00:05:44.776666	lines best and this time the criteria
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164931	136	00:05:44.776666	00:05:46.77	is more tide to the classification
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164931	137	00:05:46.77	00:05:47.17	error.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164931	138	00:05:47.17	00:05:48.44	As you will see.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164932	139	00:05:49.33	00:05:51.86	So the basic idea is to choose the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164932	140	00:05:51.86	00:05:52.69	separator.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164932	141	00:05:53.49	00:05:55.23	To maximize the margin.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164932	142	00:05:56.01	00:05:57.05	So what is the margin?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164932	143	00:05:57.05	00:05:58.06	Well, I choose.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164933	144	00:05:59.29	00:06:02.81	So I've shown some daughter lines here
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164933	145	00:06:02.81	00:06:04.87	to indicate the boundaries of those
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164933	146	00:06:04.87	00:06:06.28	data points in.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164933	147	00:06:07.56	00:06:10.93	In each class and the margin is simply
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164933	148	00:06:10.93	00:06:13.98	the distance between the line, the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164933	149	00:06:13.98	00:06:16.72	separator and the closest points from
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164933	150	00:06:16.72	00:06:17.47	each class.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164934	151	00:06:18.37	00:06:20.87	So you can see the margin of this side
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164934	152	00:06:20.87	00:06:22.66	is as I've shown here.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164934	153	00:06:23.33	00:06:25.065	And you can also define the margin on
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164934	154	00:06:25.065	00:06:25.91	the other side.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164934	155	00:06:26.87	00:06:29	And in order for the separate to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164934	156	00:06:29	00:06:32.15	maximizing the margin, it has to be
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164934	157	00:06:32.15	00:06:34.32	kind of in the middle of the two
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164935	158	00:06:34.32	00:06:36.35	boundaries, and you don't want this
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164935	159	00:06:36.35	00:06:38.98	separator to be very close to one side.

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164935	161	00:06:41.83	00:06:42.83	makes a lot of sense.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164935	162	00:06:44.04	00:06:46.91	So this is the basic idea of ecfmg.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164935	163	00:06:46.91	00:06:47.91	We're going to choose a linear
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164935	164	00:06:47.91	00:06:50.03	separator to maximize the margin.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164936	165	00:06:51.98	00:06:54.66	Now on this slide I've also changed the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164936	166	00:06:54.66	00:06:56.339999	notation so that I'm not going to use
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164936	167	00:06:56.34	00:06:56.77	beta.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164936	168	00:06:56.77	00:06:58.61	Didn't know the parameters and, but
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164936	169	00:06:58.61	00:07:01.21	instead I'm going to use W, although W
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164936	170	00:07:01.21	00:07:03.27	was used to denote the words before.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164936	171	00:07:03.27	00:07:05.1	So don't be confused here.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164937	172	00:07:05.1	00:07:09.98	W here is actually wait set of weights.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164937	173	00:07:10.99	00:07:11.44	And.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164937	174	00:07:12.6	00:07:17.19	So I'm also using locates be to denote
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164937	175	00:07:17.19	00:07:19.11	beta zero, the bias constant.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164937	176	00:07:19.9	00:07:22.23	And there are instances do represented
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164937	177	00:07:22.23	00:07:22.84	as X.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164938	178	00:07:23.86	00:07:27.09	And I also use the vector form of
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164938	179	00:07:27.09	00:07:28.48	multiplication here.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164938	180	00:07:28.48	00:07:31.85	So we see transpose of W vector
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164938	181	00:07:31.85	00:07:34.24	multiplied by the feature vector.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164938	182	00:07:35.16	00:07:38.64	So P is a biased constant and W is a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164938	183	00:07:38.64	00:07:41.56	set of weights and with one wait for
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164938	184	00:07:41.56	00:07:44.0075	each feature we have M features and so
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164939	185	00:07:44.0075	00:07:46.02	have aim weights and are represented as
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164939	186	00:07:46.02	00:07:46.6	a vector.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164939	187	00:07:47.47	00:07:50.17	An similarly the data instance.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164939	188	00:07:50.17	00:07:52.71	Here the text object is represented by
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164939	189	00:07:52.71	00:07:54.76	also a feature vector of the same
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164939	190	00:07:54.76	00:07:55.78	number of elements.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164939	191	00:07:55.78	00:07:59.53	XI is future value.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16494	192	00:07:59.53	00:08:01.1	For example word count.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16494	193	00:08:02.06	00:08:04.99	I can you can verify when we multiply
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16494	194	00:08:04.99	00:08:07.34	these two vectors together, take the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16494	195	00:08:07.34	00:08:10.68	dot product that we get the same form
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16494	196	00:08:10.68	00:08:13.58	of the NIA separate as you have seen
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16494	197	00:08:13.58	00:08:14.15	before.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16494	198	00:08:14.15	00:08:15.26	It's just a different way of
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164941	199	00:08:15.26	00:08:16.22	representing this.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164941	200	00:08:16.89	00:08:19.48	Now I use this way so that it's more
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164941	201	00:08:19.48	00:08:21.93	consistent with what notations people
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164941	202	00:08:21.93	00:08:24.58	usually use when they talk about SVM.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164941	203	00:08:24.58	00:08:25.82	This way you can.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164941	204	00:08:26.58	00:08:28.45	Better connected the slides with some
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164942	205	00:08:28.45	00:08:29.75	other readings you might do.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164942	206	00:08:31.03	00:08:31.66	OK.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164942	207	00:08:32.28	00:08:33	So.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164942	208	00:08:34.84	00:08:38.29	When we maximize the margins of
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164942	209	00:08:38.29	00:08:42.11	separate, it just means with the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164942	210	00:08:42.11	00:08:42.906666	boundary of.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164943	211	00:08:42.906666	00:08:44.97	The separate is only determined by a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164943	212	00:08:44.97	00:08:47.2475	few data points, and these are the data
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164943	213	00:08:47.2475	00:08:49.7	points that we call support vectors.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164943	214	00:08:49.7	00:08:52.01	So here are illustrated to support
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164943	215	00:08:52.01	00:08:54.72	vectors for one class and two for the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164943	216	00:08:54.72	00:08:55.3	other class.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164943	217	00:08:56.06	00:08:58.81	At this, porters define the margin
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164944	218	00:08:58.81	00:08:59.47	basically.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164944	219	00:09:00.59	00:09:03.08	And you can imagine once we know which
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164944	220	00:09:03.08	00:09:06.78	are support vectors, then this center
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164944	221	00:09:06.78	00:09:09.02	separate line will be determined by
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164944	222	00:09:09.02	00:09:10.29	them so.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164944	223	00:09:11.84	00:09:14.23	The other data points actually don't
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164944	224	00:09:14.23	00:09:15.54	really matter that much.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164945	225	00:09:16.16	00:09:18.47	And you can see if they you change
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164945	226	00:09:18.47	00:09:20.12	other data points, it won't really
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164945	227	00:09:20.12	00:09:22.07	affect the margin, so the separate with
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164945	228	00:09:22.07	00:09:24.395	the stay the same mainly affected by
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164945	229	00:09:24.395	00:09:26.2	the support vector machines.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164945	230	00:09:26.2	00:09:28.758	Sorry it's mainly affected by the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164946	231	00:09:28.758	00:09:30.41	support vectors and that's why it is
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164946	232	00:09:30.41	00:09:31.71	called a support vector machine.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164946	233	00:09:32.79	00:09:34.52	OK, so.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164946	234	00:09:35.52	00:09:37.976666	The next question is of course, how can
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164946	235	00:09:37.976666	00:09:42.112	we set it up to optimize the line?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164946	236	00:09:42.112	00:09:45.46	How can we actually find the line?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164946	237	00:09:46.01	00:09:47.27	Or the separator.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164947	238	00:09:47.27	00:09:49.66	Now this is equivalent to finding
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164947	239	00:09:49.66	00:09:53.16	values for W&B because they would
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164947	240	00:09:53.16	00:09:55.52	determine where exactly the separator
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164947	241	00:09:55.52	00:09:55.93	is.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164947	242	00:09:57.86	00:10:00.399999	So in the simplest case, the linear
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164947	243	00:10:00.4	00:10:03.93	osfm is just a simple optimization
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164947	244	00:10:03.93	00:10:04.48	problem.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164948	245	00:10:04.48	00:10:06.84	So again we let's recall that our
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164948	246	00:10:06.84	00:10:09.38	classifier is such a linear separator
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164948	247	00:10:09.38	00:10:11.36	where we have weights for all the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164948	248	00:10:11.36	00:10:13.26	features and the main goal is to learn
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164948	249	00:10:13.26	00:10:15.16	these weights W&B.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164948	250	00:10:15.25	00:10:18.613333	And the classifier will say X is in
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164948	251	00:10:18.613333	00:10:20.6	category one if it's positive.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164949	252	00:10:20.6	00:10:22.41	Otherwise it's going to say it's in the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164949	253	00:10:22.41	00:10:23.065	other category.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164949	254	00:10:23.065	00:10:26.2325	So this is our assumption or setup.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164949	255	00:10:26.2325	00:10:29.8225	So in the linear is UVM, we're going to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164949	256	00:10:29.8225	00:10:33.13	then seek these parameter values to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164949	257	00:10:33.13	00:10:36.37	optimize the margins and then the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164949	258	00:10:36.37	00:10:37.15	training error.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16495	259	00:10:38.51	00:10:40.15	The training laid out would be
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16495	260	00:10:40.15	00:10:41.84	basically like a in other classifiers
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16495	261	00:10:41.84	00:10:43.695	we have a set of training points where
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16495	262	00:10:43.695	00:10:46.66	we know the X vector and then we also
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16495	263	00:10:46.66	00:10:48.91	the corresponding label, why I?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16495	264	00:10:50.12	00:10:53.655	An here we define why I as two values,
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16495	265	00:10:53.655	00:10:56.43	but these two values are not 01 as you
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164951	266	00:10:56.43	00:10:58.06	have seen before, but rather negative
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164951	267	00:10:58.06	00:10:59.87	one and positive one and their
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164951	268	00:10:59.87	00:11:02.05	corresponding to these two categories
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164951	269	00:11:02.05	00:11:03.15	as I've shown here.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164951	270	00:11:03.84	00:11:06.31	Now you might wonder why we don't
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164951	271	00:11:06.31	00:11:09.19	define them as zero and one, but
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164952	272	00:11:09.19	00:11:12.29	instead of having negative 11 and this
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164952	273	00:11:12.29	00:11:14.283333	is purely for mathematical convenience,
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164952	274	00:11:14.283333	00:11:15.78	as you will see in a moment.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164952	275	00:11:16.58	00:11:19.4525	So the goal of optimization first is to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164952	276	00:11:19.4525	00:11:22.035	make sure the labeling on training data
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164952	277	00:11:22.035	00:11:22.98	is all correct.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164952	278	00:11:22.98	00:11:26.13	So that just means if Yi, the known
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164953	279	00:11:26.13	00:11:29.53	label, for instance XI is one we would
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164953	280	00:11:29.53	00:11:32.772	like this classify value to be large.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164953	281	00:11:32.772	00:11:35.796666	And here we just choose threshold one
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164953	282	00:11:35.796666	00:11:36.419999	here.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164953	283	00:11:36.42	00:11:38.3725	But if you use another threshold, you
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164953	284	00:11:38.3725	00:11:41.22	can see you can easily affect that
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164953	285	00:11:41.22	00:11:44.096	constant into the parameter values B&W
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164953	286	00:11:44.096	00:11:46.83	to make the right hand side.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164953	287	00:11:46.89	00:11:47.5	Just one.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164954	288	00:11:48.77	00:11:51.946666	Now, if, on the other hand, why I is
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164954	289	00:11:51.946666	00:11:53.63	negative one that means it's in a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164954	290	00:11:53.63	00:11:56.049999	different class then we want this
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164954	291	00:11:56.05	00:11:57.943333	classifier to give us a very small
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164954	292	00:11:57.943333	00:11:58.226666	value.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164954	293	00:11:58.226666	00:12:00.069999	In fact a negative value.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164955	294	00:12:00.07	00:12:02.63	And we want this value to be less than
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164955	295	00:12:02.63	00:12:04.25	or equal to negative one.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164955	296	00:12:05.3	00:12:09.01	These are the two different instances,
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164955	297	00:12:09.01	00:12:12.376666	different kinds of cases and how can we
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164955	298	00:12:12.376666	00:12:14.42	combine them together now.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164955	299	00:12:14.42	00:12:17.2	This is where it's convenient when we
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164956	300	00:12:17.2	00:12:20.79	have chosen why I as negative one for
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164956	301	00:12:20.79	00:12:22.86	the other category cause it turns out
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164956	302	00:12:22.86	00:12:24.87	that we can easily combine the two into
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164956	303	00:12:24.87	00:12:25.87	one constraint.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164956	304	00:12:26.51	00:12:29.24	Why I multiplied by the classifier
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164956	305	00:12:29.24	00:12:31.8	value must be larger than or equal to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164956	306	00:12:31.8	00:12:32.29	1?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164957	307	00:12:33.07	00:12:34.11	An obviously when?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164957	308	00:12:34.11	00:12:36.63	Why is just one you see.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164957	309	00:12:36.63	00:12:38.155	This is the same as the constraint on
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164957	310	00:12:38.155	00:12:39.1	the left hand side.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164957	311	00:12:40.04	00:12:42.84	But when Yi is negative one you also
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164957	312	00:12:42.84	00:12:44.33	see a new.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164957	313	00:12:44.33	00:12:46.94	This is equivalent to the other
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164958	314	00:12:46.94	00:12:49.47	inequality, so this one actually
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164958	315	00:12:49.47	00:12:52.61	captures both constraints in a unified
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164958	316	00:12:52.61	00:12:54.77	way, and that's a convenient way of
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164958	317	00:12:54.77	00:12:56.01	capturing these constraints.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164958	318	00:12:56.63	00:12:57.98	What's our second goal?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164958	319	00:12:57.98	00:12:58.68	That's true.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164959	320	00:12:58.68	00:12:59.98	Maximizing margin, right?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164959	321	00:12:59.98	00:13:02.709999	So we want to ensure the separate can
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164959	322	00:13:02.71	00:13:05.2	do well on the training data, but then,
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164959	323	00:13:05.2	00:13:07.23	among all the cases where we can
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164959	324	00:13:07.23	00:13:08.76	separate the data, we also would like
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164959	325	00:13:08.76	00:13:10.93	to choose the separate that has the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164959	326	00:13:10.93	00:13:12.25	largest margin.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16496	327	00:13:12.25	00:13:15.81	Now the margin can be shown to be
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16496	328	00:13:15.81	00:13:17.59	related to the magnitude of the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16496	329	00:13:17.59	00:13:18.07	weights.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16496	330	00:13:25.97	00:13:28.57	The sum of squares of all those
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16496	331	00:13:28.57	00:13:29.04	weights.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16496	332	00:13:29.6	00:13:34.06	So this to have a small value for this
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16496	333	00:13:34.06	00:13:34.93	expression.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164961	334	00:13:34.93	00:13:40.24	It means all the eyes must be small.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164961	335	00:13:42.31	00:13:44.62	So we've just assume that we have a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164961	336	00:13:44.62	00:13:48.42	constraint for the getting the data on
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164961	337	00:13:48.42	00:13:49.99	the training set to be classified
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164961	338	00:13:49.99	00:13:50.74	correctly.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164961	339	00:13:50.74	00:13:53.21	Now we also have the objective that's
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164962	340	00:13:53.21	00:13:56.65	Tide to maximization of margin and this
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164962	341	00:13:56.65	00:14:00.51	is simply to maximize sorry to minimize
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164962	342	00:14:00.51	00:14:03.23	W transpose multiplied by W and we
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164962	343	00:14:03.23	00:14:05.34	often denote this by file W.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164962	344	00:14:06.44	00:14:08.51	So now you can see this is basically
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164962	345	00:14:08.51	00:14:10.47	optimization problem, right?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164962	346	00:14:10.47	00:14:13.8	We have some variables to optimize and
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164963	347	00:14:13.8	00:14:16.761818	these are the weights and B and we have
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164963	348	00:14:16.761818	00:14:17.396363	some constraints.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164963	349	00:14:17.396363	00:14:19.299999	These are linear constraints and the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164963	350	00:14:19.3	00:14:20.784	objective function is a quadratic
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164963	351	00:14:20.784	00:14:21.844285	function of the weights.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164963	352	00:14:21.844285	00:14:24.4025	So this is a quadratic program with
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164963	353	00:14:24.4025	00:14:25.8	linear constraints and there are
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164964	354	00:14:25.8	00:14:27.47	standard algorithms that are available
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164964	355	00:14:27.47	00:14:29.29	for solving this problem.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164964	356	00:14:29.9	00:14:31.51	And once we solve, the problem, will
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164964	357	00:14:31.51	00:14:34.902	obtain the weights W&B and then this
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164964	358	00:14:34.902	00:14:36.75	would give us a well defined the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164965	359	00:14:36.75	00:14:38.845	classifier, so we can then use this
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164965	360	00:14:38.845	00:14:41.04	classifier to classify any new texture
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164965	361	00:14:41.04	00:14:41.83	objects.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164965	362	00:14:41.83	00:14:44.88	Now the previous formulation did not
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164965	363	00:14:44.88	00:14:47.08	allow any error in the classification,
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164965	364	00:14:47.08	00:14:48.91	but sometimes the data may not be
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164965	365	00:14:48.91	00:14:50.09	linearly separable.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164966	366	00:14:50.09	00:14:53.54	That means they may not look as nice as
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164966	367	00:14:53.54	00:14:56.32	you have seen on the previous slide
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164966	368	00:14:56.32	00:14:58.915	where align can separate all of them.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164966	369	00:14:58.915	00:15:00.65	And what would happen if we.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164966	370	00:15:00.71	00:15:02	Allow some errors.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164966	371	00:15:02.7	00:15:05.06	The principle can stay right, so we
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164966	372	00:15:05.06	00:15:06.56	want to minimize the training error,
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164967	373	00:15:06.56	00:15:09.42	but try to also maximize the margin.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164967	374	00:15:09.99	00:15:12.14	But in this case we have a soft margin
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164967	375	00:15:12.14	00:15:15.05	because the data points may not be a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164967	376	00:15:15.05	00:15:16.18	completely separate bowl.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164967	377	00:15:16.88	00:15:18.94	So it turns out that we can easily
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164967	378	00:15:18.94	00:15:23.19	modify it as VM to accommodate this.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164968	379	00:15:24.48	00:15:26.75625	So what you see here is very similar to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164968	380	00:15:26.75625	00:15:28.52	what you have seen before, but we have
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164968	381	00:15:28.52	00:15:30.41	introduced the extra variables.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164968	382	00:15:30.41	00:15:33.29	Cassie I an we in fact will have one
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164968	383	00:15:33.29	00:15:36.2	for each data instance and this is
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164968	384	00:15:36.2	00:15:38.02	going to model the error that will
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164968	385	00:15:38.02	00:15:40.162	allow for each instance.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164969	386	00:15:40.162	00:15:42.49	But the optimization problem will be
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164969	387	00:15:42.49	00:15:43.35	very similar.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164969	388	00:15:44.76	00:15:47.0825	So specifically, you will see we have
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164969	389	00:15:47.0825	00:15:48.9	added something to the optimization
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164969	390	00:15:48.9	00:15:49.53	problem.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164969	391	00:15:49.53	00:15:52.76	First we have added some.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164969	392	00:15:54.15	00:15:58.54	Some error to the constraint so that
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16497	393	00:15:58.54	00:16:00.77	now we allow.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16497	394	00:16:02.08	00:16:05.22	Allow the classifier to make some
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16497	395	00:16:05.22	00:16:11.58	mistakes here, so this KCI is allowed
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16497	396	00:16:11.58	00:16:14.99	error if we set KCI to 0, then we go
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16497	397	00:16:14.99	00:16:16.295	back to the original constraint.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16497	398	00:16:16.295	00:16:18.86	We want every instance we classified
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16497	399	00:16:18.86	00:16:22.33	accurately, but if we allow this to be.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164971	400	00:16:23.62	00:16:26.125	Zero, then we allow some errors here.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164971	401	00:16:26.125	00:16:28.11	In fact, the one CI is very large.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164971	402	00:16:28.11	00:16:30.66	The error can be very, very large, so
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164971	403	00:16:30.66	00:16:33.09	naturally we don't want this to happen.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164971	404	00:16:33.09	00:16:36.675	So we want to then also minimize this
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164971	405	00:16:36.675	00:16:37.5675	CI.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164972	406	00:16:37.5675	00:16:40.9	So Cassie, I needs to be minimized in
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164972	407	00:16:40.9	00:16:42.04	order to control the error.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164972	408	00:16:42.81	00:16:45.52	And so as a result in the objective
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164972	409	00:16:45.52	00:16:47.83	function we also add more to the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164972	410	00:16:47.83	00:16:51.47	original 1, which is only an by
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164972	411	00:16:51.47	00:16:53.49	basically ensuring that we're going to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164972	412	00:16:53.49	00:16:55.963333	not only minimize the weights, but also
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164973	413	00:16:55.963333	00:16:59.429999	minimize the errors as you see here, we
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164973	414	00:16:59.43	00:17:01.79	simply take a sum over all the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164973	415	00:17:01.79	00:17:02.71	instances.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164973	416	00:17:02.71	00:17:06.22	Each one has a CI to model the error
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164973	417	00:17:06.22	00:17:08.69	allowed for that instance an when we
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164973	418	00:17:08.69	00:17:12.19	combine them together, we basically
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164973	419	00:17:12.19	00:17:14.09	want to minimize the errors on.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164973	420	00:17:14.14	00:17:14.92	All of them.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164974	421	00:17:16.19	00:17:17.84	Now you see there's a parameter.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164974	422	00:17:17.84	00:17:19.71	See here and that's a constant to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164974	423	00:17:19.71	00:17:21.96	control the tradeoff between minimizing
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164974	424	00:17:21.96	00:17:24.903333	the errors and maximizing the region of
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164974	425	00:17:24.903333	00:17:27.98	the margin if C is set to zero, you can
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164974	426	00:17:27.98	00:17:30.83	see we go back to the original object
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164974	427	00:17:30.83	00:17:33.18	function where we only maximize margin.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164975	428	00:17:34.13	00:17:36.55	And we don't really optimize the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164975	429	00:17:36.55	00:17:39.25	training errors and then see I can be
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164975	430	00:17:39.25	00:17:41.27	set to a very large value to make the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164975	431	00:17:41.27	00:17:43.2	constraints easy to satisfy.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164975	432	00:17:43.2	00:17:46.12	That's not very good of course, so see
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164975	433	00:17:46.12	00:17:48.79	should be set to a non 0 value and a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164975	434	00:17:48.79	00:17:50.27	positive value.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164976	435	00:17:50.88	00:17:53	But when she is settled very, very
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164976	436	00:17:53	00:17:54.69	large value would see the objective
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164976	437	00:17:54.69	00:17:56.587142	function will be dominated mostly by
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164976	438	00:17:56.587142	00:17:59.029999	the training errors and so the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164976	439	00:17:59.03	00:18:01.24	optimization of margin will then play a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164976	440	00:18:01.24	00:18:02.125	secondary role.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164977	441	00:18:02.125	00:18:05.08625	So if that happens, what would happen?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164977	442	00:18:05.08625	00:18:08.69	What would happen is then we will try
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164977	443	00:18:08.69	00:18:10.918	to do our best to minimize the training
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164977	444	00:18:10.918	00:18:11.192	errors.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164977	445	00:18:11.192	00:18:13.525	But then we're not going to take care
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164977	446	00:18:13.525	00:18:15.66	of the margin and that affects the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164977	447	00:18:15.66	00:18:17.509999	generalization capacity of the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164977	448	00:18:17.51	00:18:18.995	classifier for future data.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164978	449	00:18:18.995	00:18:20.66	So it's also not good.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164978	450	00:18:20.9	00:18:24	So apparently this parameter C has to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164978	451	00:18:24	00:18:25.58	be actually set.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164978	452	00:18:27.21	00:18:30.19	Carefully, and this is just like in the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164978	453	00:18:30.19	00:18:32.152	case of nearest neighbor way you need
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164978	454	00:18:32.152	00:18:33.81	to optimize the number of neighbors.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164978	455	00:18:33.81	00:18:35.9875	Here you need to optimize the C and
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164979	456	00:18:35.9875	00:18:39.27	this is the general also achievable by
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164979	457	00:18:39.27	00:18:40.46	doing cross validation.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164979	458	00:18:40.46	00:18:41.73	Basically you look at the empirical
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164979	459	00:18:41.73	00:18:44.903333	data to see what values should be set
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164979	460	00:18:44.903333	00:18:46.9	to in order to optimize the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164979	461	00:18:46.9	00:18:47.68	performance.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164979	462	00:18:48.87	00:18:50.47	Now with this modification in the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16498	463	00:18:50.47	00:18:52.105	problem, is there a quadratic program
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16498	464	00:18:52.105	00:18:53.57	with linear constraints, so the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16498	465	00:18:53.57	00:18:55.31	optimization algorithm can be actually
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16498	466	00:18:55.31	00:18:58.62	applied to solve this different version
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16498	467	00:18:58.62	00:19:00.32	of the program?
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164982	468	00:19:01.94	00:19:03.94	Again, once we have obtained the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164982	469	00:19:03.94	00:19:07.62	weights and the bias, then we can have
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164982	470	00:19:07.62	00:19:08.57	classified.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164982	471	00:19:08.57	00:19:10.32	That's ready for classifying new
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164982	472	00:19:10.32	00:19:11.06	objects.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164982	473	00:19:11.06	00:19:13.62	So that's the basic idea of Sven.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164982	474	00:19:17.04	00:19:18.6	So to summarize, the text
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164983	475	00:19:18.6	00:19:20.82	categorisation methods we have
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164983	476	00:19:20.82	00:19:23.79	introduced many methods and some are

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164996	569	00:23:10.97	00:23:12.84	which category tends to be confused
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164997	570	00:23:12.84	00:23:16.16	with each other categories and you can
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164997	571	00:23:16.16	00:23:18.57	use a confusion matrix to examine the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164997	572	00:23:18.57	00:23:20.62	errors systematically across

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164998	580	00:23:37.28	00:23:38.69	general, and that's where you can get
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164998	581	00:23:38.69	00:23:40.44	the insights about your specific

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164999	583	00:23:41.99	00:23:44.07	And then finally we can leverage some
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164999	584	00:23:44.07	00:23:45.49	machine learning techniques.

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164999	586	00:23:47.25	00:23:48.67	technique that we haven't really talked

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164999	588	00:23:50.5	00:23:52.59	has to do with trying to select the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164999	589	00:23:52.59	00:23:54.11	most useful features before you
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.164999	590	00:23:54.11	00:23:56.45	actually trainer for classifier, and
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165	591	00:23:56.45	00:23:57.99	sometimes training a classifier would
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165	592	00:23:57.99	00:23:59.81	also help you identify which features
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165	593	00:23:59.81	00:24:00.85	have high values.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165	594	00:24:01.54	00:24:03.73	And there are also other ways to ensure
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165	595	00:24:03.73	00:24:05.61	the sparsity of the model.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165	596	00:24:05.61	00:24:07.5	Meaning to recognize the weights.

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165001	598	00:24:10.695	00:24:12.82	to minimize the weights on features,
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165001	599	00:24:12.82	00:24:15.895	but you can further for some features
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165001	600	00:24:15.895	00:24:18.856666	to falsely use only a small number of

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165019	719	00:29:04.79	00:29:07.72	have a lot of unable text data for
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165019	720	00:29:07.72	00:29:11.38	categorization then you can actually do
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165019	721	00:29:11.38	00:29:14.74	clustering on these text data to learn
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16502	722	00:29:14.74	00:29:15.51	categories.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16502	723	00:29:15.56	00:29:17.45	And then try to somehow align these
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16502	724	00:29:17.45	00:29:22.05	categories with the categories defined
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16502	725	00:29:22.05	00:29:23.87	by the training data where we already
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.16502	726	00:29:23.87	00:29:25.08	know which documents are in which
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165021	727	00:29:25.08	00:29:25.71	category.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165021	728	00:29:25.71	00:29:29.585	So you can in fact use the EM algorithm
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165021	729	00:29:29.585	00:29:31.5	to actually combine both.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165021	730	00:29:31.5	00:29:33.56	That would allow you essentially to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165021	731	00:29:33.56	00:29:36.131428	also pick up a useful words in the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165022	732	00:29:36.131428	00:29:36.865714	unlabeled data.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165022	733	00:29:36.865714	00:29:39.24	You can think of this in another way.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165022	734	00:29:39.24	00:29:41.72	Basically, we can use, let's say a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165022	735	00:29:41.72	00:29:44.493333	naive Bayes classifier to classify all

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165023	737	00:29:47.32	00:29:49.35	And then we're going to assume the high
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165023	738	00:29:49.35	00:29:52.61	confidence classification results, or
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165023	739	00:29:52.61	00:29:53.67	actually reliable.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165023	740	00:29:53.67	00:29:55.34	Then you certainly have more training
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165023	741	00:29:55.34	00:29:55.58	data.

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165024	743	00:29:59.1	00:30:01.876	some are labeled as category ones and
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165024	744	00:30:01.876	00:30:03.27	more labeled as category two.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165024	745	00:30:03.27	00:30:05.22	Although the label is not completely
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165024	746	00:30:05.22	00:30:05.93	reliable.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165025	747	00:30:05.93	00:30:07.84	But then they can still be useful.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165025	748	00:30:07.84	00:30:10.612727	So let's assume they are actually
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165025	749	00:30:10.612727	00:30:13.759999	training label examples and then we
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165025	750	00:30:13.76	00:30:16.665	combine them with the true training
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165025	751	00:30:16.665	00:30:17.44	examples.

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165026	753	00:30:20.74	00:30:24.6	this idea is very powerful and when the
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165026	754	00:30:24.6	00:30:27.1525	enable data and training data are very
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165026	755	00:30:27.1525	00:30:29.56	different and we might need to use
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165026	756	00:30:29.56	00:30:30.99	other advanced machine learning

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165027	758	00:30:33.83	00:30:37.47	transfer learning, this is when we can
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165027	759	00:30:37.47	00:30:39.57	borrow some training examples from a
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165027	760	00:30:39.57	00:30:41.804	related problem that may be different
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165027	761	00:30:41.804	00:30:44.88	or from a categorisation task that.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165027	762	00:30:46.03	00:30:48.395	That involves data that follow very
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165028	763	00:30:48.395	00:30:50.555	different distributions from what we
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165028	764	00:30:50.555	00:30:51.835	are working on.
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165028	765	00:30:51.835	00:30:53.645	But basically when the two domains are
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165028	766	00:30:53.645	00:30:54.74	very different than we need to be
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165028	767	00:30:54.74	00:30:56.75	careful not to overfit the training
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165029	768	00:30:56.75	00:30:58.95	domain, but yet we can still want to
7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165029	769	00:30:58.95	00:31:00.78	use some signals from the related

7f9f9b1e-4527-4875-b6f7-4dc0d57ab719	2020-11-02 23:07:01.165029	772	00:31:04.95	00:31:07.73	on news might not give you an

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060697	12	00:00:33.03	00:00:34.863333	text clustering and white text
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:00:41.335492	12	00:00:33.03	00:00:34.863333	text clustering and why text
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060697	13	00:00:34.863333	00:00:36.44	classroom is interesting.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-30 14:11:31.208949	13	00:00:34.863333	00:00:36.44	clustering is interesting.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060698	14	00:00:37.12	00:00:38.68	In this lecture we're going to talk
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060698	15	00:00:38.68	00:00:40.88	about how to do text clustering now in
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:00:54.355471	15	00:00:38.68	00:00:40.88	about how to do text clustering, in
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060699	16	00:00:40.88	00:00:42.53	general, as you see on this slide,
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060699	17	00:00:42.53	00:00:44.88	there are two kinds of approaches.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.0607	18	00:00:44.88	00:00:47.45	One is generating probabilistic models,
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.0607	19	00:00:47.45	00:00:49.77	which is the topic of this lecture, and
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060701	20	00:00:49.77	00:00:51.64	later will also discuss similarity
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060701	21	00:00:51.64	00:00:52.77	based approaches.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060701	22	00:00:53.75	00:00:57	So to talk about generating models for
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-30 14:11:42.220312	22	00:00:53.75	00:00:57	So to talk about generative models for
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060702	23	00:00:57	00:01:00.32	text clustering, it would be useful to
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060702	24	00:01:00.32	00:01:04.04	revisit the topic mining problem using
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060702	25	00:01:04.04	00:01:05.33	topic models.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060703	26	00:01:06.22	00:01:07.93	Because the two problems are very
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060703	27	00:01:07.93	00:01:10.59	similar, so this is a slide that you
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060704	28	00:01:10.59	00:01:13.69	have seen earlier in the intellectual
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:01:51.974171	28	00:01:10.59	00:01:13.69	have seen earlier in the lecture
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060704	29	00:01:13.69	00:01:15.05	on topic model.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060705	30	00:01:15.05	00:01:19.01	Here we show that we have input of text
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060705	31	00:01:19.01	00:01:22.82	collection C and number of topics K and
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060705	32	00:01:22.82	00:01:25.35	vocabulary V, and we hope to generate
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060706	33	00:01:25.35	00:01:27.64	as output 2 two things.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:02:07.468573	33	00:01:25.35	00:01:27.64	as output two things.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060706	34	00:01:27.64	00:01:30.99	One is a set of topics denoted by Theta
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060707	35	00:01:30.99	00:01:31.54	eyes.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:02:19.871608	35	00:01:30.99	00:01:31.54	i's.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060707	36	00:01:32.09	00:01:33.989999	Each is a water distribution and the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:02:31.272608	36	00:01:32.09	00:01:33.989999	Each is a word distribution and the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060708	37	00:01:33.99	00:01:36.77	other is a pie ideas and these are the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:02:55.208508	37	00:01:33.99	00:01:36.77	other is a pi ij's and these are the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060708	38	00:01:36.77	00:01:40.71	probabilities that each document covers
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060709	39	00:01:40.71	00:01:42.05	each topic.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060709	40	00:01:42.05	00:01:44.64	So this is a public coverage and it's
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:03:07.716944	40	00:01:42.05	00:01:44.64	So this is a topic coverage and it's
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060709	41	00:01:44.64	00:01:47.24	also visualized here on this slide you
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06071	42	00:01:47.24	00:01:49.77	can see that this is what we can get by
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06071	43	00:01:49.77	00:01:50.8	using a topic model.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060711	44	00:01:51.42	00:01:54.79	Now a main difference between this and
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060712	45	00:01:54.79	00:01:58.035	text clustering problem is that here a
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060712	46	00:01:58.035	00:02:01.4	document is assumed to possibly cover
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060713	47	00:02:01.4	00:02:04.82	multiple topics, and indeed in general
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060713	48	00:02:04.82	00:02:08.78	document will be covering more than one
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060713	49	00:02:08.78	00:02:11.61	topic with non zero probabilities.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060714	50	00:02:12.69	00:02:16.99	In text clustering, however, we only
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060714	51	00:02:16.99	00:02:20.22	allow a document to cover one topic.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060715	52	00:02:20.22	00:02:22.58	If we assume one topic is a cluster.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060715	53	00:02:24.19	00:02:24.93	So.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060716	54	00:02:26.41	00:02:28.85	That means if we change the problem
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:04:07.173248	54	00:02:26.41	00:02:28.85	That means if we change the topic
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060716	55	00:02:28.85	00:02:31.2	definition just slightly by assuming
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060717	56	00:02:31.2	00:02:33.66	that each document account may be
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:03:50.069814	56	00:02:31.2	00:02:33.66	that each document can only be
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060717	57	00:02:33.66	00:02:35.99	generated by using precise one topic.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:04:14.39388	57	00:02:33.66	00:02:35.99	generated by using precisely one topic.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060718	58	00:02:37.07	00:02:39.05	Then we'll have a definition of the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060718	59	00:02:39.05	00:02:39.98	clustering problem.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060718	60	00:02:40.58	00:02:41.42	As you hear.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:04:25.019251	60	00:02:40.58	00:02:41.42	As shown here.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060719	61	00:02:42.09	00:02:46.1	So here the output is changed so that
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060719	62	00:02:46.1	00:02:48.21	we no longer have the detailed coverage
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06072	63	00:02:48.21	00:02:51.2	distributions pious, but instead will
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:04:40.177068	63	00:02:48.21	00:02:51.2	distributions pi ij's, but instead will
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06072	64	00:02:51.2	00:02:54.62	have cluster assignment decisions.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060721	65	00:02:54.62	00:02:59.62	An CI and CI is decision for the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060721	66	00:02:59.62	00:03:00.59	document.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:04:46.836159	66	00:02:59.62	00:03:00.59	document i.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060722	67	00:03:00.59	00:03:04.39	I an see somebody is going to take a
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:05:03.715875	67	00:03:00.59	00:03:04.39	And see sub i is going to take a
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-30 14:13:12.322415	67	00:03:00.59	00:03:04.39	And c sub i is going to take a
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060722	68	00:03:04.39	00:03:06.75	value from one through K to indicate
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060722	69	00:03:06.75	00:03:08.27	one of the K clusters.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060723	70	00:03:09.12	00:03:13.26	And basically tells us document the eye

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060726	76	00:03:25.94	00:03:26.52	uncertain.

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060728	80	00:03:34.25	00:03:36.83	So here again it's a slide that you
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060728	81	00:03:36.83	00:03:37.94	have seen before.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060728	82	00:03:38.54	00:03:42.33	And here we hope to estimate a topic
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060729	83	00:03:42.33	00:03:45.65	model award distribution based on

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06073	85	00:03:47.825	00:03:49.83	we assume that this document covers
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06073	86	00:03:49.83	00:03:51.309999	precisely one topic.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060731	87	00:03:52.89	00:03:54.229999	But we can also consider some
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060731	88	00:03:54.23	00:03:55.51	variations of the problem.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060731	89	00:03:55.51	00:03:58.12	For example, we can consider there are
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060732	90	00:03:58.12	00:04:00.32	N documents, each covers different
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060732	91	00:04:00.32	00:04:00.835	topic.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060733	92	00:04:00.835	00:04:03.936	So that's N documents and topics.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060733	93	00:04:03.936	00:04:06.268333	Of course, in this case these documents
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060733	94	00:04:06.268333	00:04:08.513332	are independent and these topics also
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060734	95	00:04:08.513332	00:04:08.887499	independent.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060735	96	00:04:08.887499	00:04:11.616666	But we can further allow these
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060735	97	00:04:11.616666	00:04:13.92	documents share topics and why.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:06:07.169373	97	00:04:11.616666	00:04:13.92	documents share topics and then.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060735	98	00:04:13.92	00:04:16.64	We can also assume that we are going to
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060735	99	00:04:16.64	00:04:18.485	assume there are fewer topics.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060735	100	00:04:18.485	00:04:19.885	The number of documents.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060736	101	00:04:19.885	00:04:22.6625	So this document must share some
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060736	102	00:04:22.6625	00:04:23.23	topics.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060736	103	00:04:24	00:04:25.41	And if we have N documents for
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060737	104	00:04:25.41	00:04:29.97	sharecare topics, then will again have
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:06:21.559502	104	00:04:25.41	00:04:29.97	share k topics, then will again have
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060738	105	00:04:29.97	00:04:32	precisely the document clustering
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060738	106	00:04:32	00:04:32.5	problem.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060738	107	00:04:34.24	00:04:35.78	So because of these connections,
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060739	108	00:04:35.78	00:04:37.65	naturally we can think about how to use
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060739	109	00:04:37.65	00:04:39.42	a probabilistic generating model to
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06074	110	00:04:39.42	00:04:41.43	solve the problem of text clustering.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06074	111	00:04:43.33	00:04:45.59	So the question now is what generating
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060741	112	00:04:45.59	00:04:47.82	model can be used to do clustering.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060741	113	00:04:48.7	00:04:51.041111	As in all cases of designing a
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060742	114	00:04:51.041111	00:04:52.868888	generative model, we hope the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060742	115	00:04:52.868888	00:04:55.91	generative model would adopt the output
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060743	116	00:04:55.91	00:04:57.7275	that we hope to generate, or the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060743	117	00:04:57.7275	00:04:59.43	structure that we hope to model.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060743	118	00:04:59.43	00:05:01.45	So in this case it's a clustering
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060744	119	00:05:01.45	00:05:02.585	structure.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060744	120	00:05:02.585	00:05:06.52	The topics and each document that
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060744	121	00:05:06.52	00:05:09.71	covers one topic, and we hope to embed
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060744	122	00:05:09.71	00:05:13.31	such such preferences in a generating
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:06:58.073467	122	00:05:09.71	00:05:13.31	such such preferences in a generative
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060745	123	00:05:13.31	00:05:13.75	model.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060745	124	00:05:15.62	00:05:16.899999	But if you think about the main
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060746	125	00:05:16.9	00:05:19.1575	difference between this problem and the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060746	126	00:05:19.1575	00:05:20.52	topic model that we talked about
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060747	127	00:05:20.52	00:05:23.8	earlier and then you will see a main
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060747	128	00:05:23.8	00:05:27.53	requirement is how can we force every
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060747	129	00:05:27.53	00:05:30.24	document to be generated from precisely
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060748	130	00:05:30.24	00:05:32.52	one topic instead of K topics?
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060748	131	00:05:33.55	00:05:34.89	As in the topic model.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060749	132	00:05:35.84	00:05:39.71	So let's revisit the topic model again
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060749	133	00:05:39.71	00:05:41.265	in more detail.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06075	134	00:05:41.265	00:05:44.55	So this is a detailed view of two
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06075	135	00:05:44.55	00:05:46.89	component mixture model and when we
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06075	136	00:05:46.89	00:05:49.14	have K components it looks similar.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060751	137	00:05:49.84	00:05:52.36	So here we see that when we generate a
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060751	138	00:05:52.36	00:05:53.04	document.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060751	139	00:05:53.77	00:05:56.41	We generated each word independent.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:07:28.378288	139	00:05:53.77	00:05:56.41	We generated each word independently.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060752	140	00:05:57.38	00:05:59.51	And we generated each word with.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:07:35.959909	140	00:05:57.38	00:05:59.51	And we generated each word
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060752	141	00:05:59.51	00:06:03.16	First make a choice between these
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060753	142	00:06:03.16	00:06:05.86	distributions with decided to use one
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060753	143	00:06:05.86	00:06:08.7	of them with probability.

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:08:52.624465	164	00:06:57.54	00:07:00.64	Now this is not what we want to see

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060763	167	00:07:04.07	00:07:06.32	this document will be generated from
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060763	168	00:07:06.32	00:07:07.53	precisely one topic.

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060764	170	00:07:12.45	00:07:15.65	model, but how well, let's first think
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060764	171	00:07:15.65	00:07:19.25	about why this model cannot be used for
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060765	172	00:07:19.25	00:07:22.35	clustering, and I just say the reason
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060765	173	00:07:22.35	00:07:23.46	is becausw.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:09:08.721903	173	00:07:22.35	00:07:23.46	is because.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060766	174	00:07:23.46	00:07:26.06	It has allowed multiple topics to
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060766	175	00:07:26.06	00:07:28.16	contribute the words to the document.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060766	176	00:07:28.74	00:07:31.03	And that causes confusion because we're
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060767	177	00:07:31.03	00:07:33.19	not going to know which cluster this

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060768	180	00:07:36.66	00:07:39.1	assumption about the partitioning of

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060769	183	00:07:43.54	00:07:45.62	correspond to one cluster of documents,
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06077	184	00:07:45.62	00:07:48.871428	then we would have a document to be
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06077	185	00:07:48.871428	00:07:50.63	generated from precisely one topic.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060771	186	00:07:50.63	00:07:53.486666	That means all the words in the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060771	187	00:07:53.486666	00:07:55.68	document must have been generated from
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060771	188	00:07:55.68	00:07:57.92	precise around distribution, and this
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:09:34.876558	188	00:07:55.68	00:07:57.92	precisely one distribution, and this
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060772	189	00:07:57.92	00:08:00.66	is not true for such a topic model that
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060772	190	00:08:00.66	00:08:02.74	we're seeing here, and that's why this
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060772	191	00:08:02.74	00:08:06.14	cannot be used for clustering because
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060773	192	00:08:06.14	00:08:09.22	it did not ensure that only one
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060773	193	00:08:09.22	00:08:11.01	distribution has been used to generate.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060774	194	00:08:11.15	00:08:13.25	All the words in one document.

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060775	196	00:08:17.52	00:08:20.04	can naturally design alternative

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060775	199	00:08:24.49	00:08:27.36	we again would have to make a decision
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060776	200	00:08:27.36	00:08:29.125	regarding which is distributing views

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060778	206	00:08:39.73	00:08:42.11	decision to choose one of the topics,

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060779	208	00:08:44.39	00:08:46.73	distribution to generate the all the

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060781	215	00:09:02.87	00:09:03.99	words in the document.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060781	216	00:09:04.8	00:09:06.95	So in other words, we only make the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060782	217	00:09:06.95	00:09:08.11	choice once.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060782	218	00:09:08.74	00:09:09.4	Fall.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:10:34.689595	218	00:09:08.74	00:09:09.4	for all.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060783	219	00:09:10.42	00:09:12.99	Basically we make the digit ones for
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:10:42.583	219	00:09:10.42	00:09:12.99	Basically we make the decision once for

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060784	221	00:09:15.31	00:09:16.35	generate all the world.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:10:48.497333	221	00:09:15.31	00:09:16.35	generate all the words.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060784	222	00:09:18.41	00:09:21.42	Similarly, if I had chosen the second
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060784	223	00:09:21.42	00:09:23.32	distribution, set us up to here, you
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:10:58.998728	223	00:09:21.42	00:09:23.32	distribution, theta sub two here, you
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060784	224	00:09:23.32	00:09:25.23	can see will stay with this one and
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:11:17.453306	224	00:09:23.32	00:09:25.23	can see we will stay with this one and
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060785	225	00:09:25.23	00:09:27.87	then generate the entire document D.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060785	226	00:09:28.79	00:09:30.375	Now, if you compare this picture with
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060786	227	00:09:30.375	00:09:33.29	the previous one, you will see the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060786	228	00:09:33.29	00:09:34.54	desicion of.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060787	229	00:09:36.35	00:09:39.65	Of using a particular distribution is
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060787	230	00:09:39.65	00:09:42.486666	made of just once for this document.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060787	231	00:09:42.486666	00:09:44.31	In the case of document password.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:11:43.852341	231	00:09:42.486666	00:09:44.31	In the case of document clustering.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060787	232	00:09:44.31	00:09:46.52	But in the case of topic model we have
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060788	233	00:09:46.52	00:09:49.79	to make as many decisions as the number
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060788	234	00:09:49.79	00:09:51.51	of words in the document because for
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060788	235	00:09:51.51	00:09:53.34	each word we can make a potential
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060789	236	00:09:53.34	00:09:55.58	different decision and that's the key
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060789	237	00:09:55.58	00:09:57.15	difference between the two models.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060789	238	00:09:58.16	00:09:59.82	But this is obviously also a mixture
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06079	239	00:09:59.82	00:10:01.63	model, so we can just group them
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06079	240	00:10:01.63	00:10:05.203333	together as one box to show that this
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06079	241	00:10:05.203333	00:10:05.549999	is.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060791	242	00:10:06.21	00:10:08.39	Model that will give us a probability
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060791	243	00:10:08.39	00:10:09.34	of a document.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060791	244	00:10:10.38	00:10:12.665	Now inside this model there's also
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060792	245	00:10:12.665	00:10:14.48	this, which of choosing a different
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060792	246	00:10:14.48	00:10:16.65	distribution and we don't observe that,
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060792	247	00:10:16.65	00:10:18.1	so that's a mixture model.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060793	248	00:10:19.11	00:10:21.34	And of course, the main problem in
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060793	249	00:10:21.34	00:10:23.58	document clustering is to infer.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060793	250	00:10:24.76	00:10:26.68	Which distribution has been used to
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060794	251	00:10:26.68	00:10:29.09	generator a document and that would
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060794	252	00:10:29.09	00:10:30.94	allow us to recover the cluster
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060794	253	00:10:30.94	00:10:32.41	identity over document?
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:12:22.554062	253	00:10:30.94	00:10:32.41	identity over document
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060795	254	00:10:37.69	00:10:40.28	So it would be useful to think about
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060795	255	00:10:40.28	00:10:42.7	the difference from the topic model, as
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060796	256	00:10:42.7	00:10:44.77	I have also mentioned multiple times.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060796	257	00:10:45.85	00:10:48.6	There are many.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060797	258	00:10:50.05	00:10:51.03	Two differences.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060797	259	00:10:51.03	00:10:54.35	One is the choice of.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060797	260	00:10:56.07	00:10:59.08	Using a particular distribution is made
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060798	261	00:10:59.08	00:11:01.14	just once for document clustering
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060798	262	00:11:01.14	00:11:04.74	model, whereas in the topic model it's
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060798	263	00:11:04.74	00:11:05.96	made multiple times.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060799	264	00:11:06.77	00:11:07.855	Four different words.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060799	265	00:11:07.855	00:11:11.45	The second is that word distribution
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060799	266	00:11:11.45	00:11:15.14	here is going to be used to generate
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.0608	267	00:11:15.14	00:11:17.93	all the words for a document.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.0608	268	00:11:19.17	00:11:22.8	But in the case of topic modeling, one
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.0608	269	00:11:22.8	00:11:24.51	distribution doesn't have to join with
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:13:00.686366	269	00:11:22.8	00:11:24.51	distribution doesn't have to generate with

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060801	271	00:11:26.67	00:11:28.48	Multiple distribution could have been
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060801	272	00:11:28.48	00:11:31.136	used to generate the words in the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060802	273	00:11:31.136	00:11:31.52	document.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060802	274	00:11:34.44	00:11:36.46	It's also think about the special case
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060802	275	00:11:36.46	00:11:39.82	when one of the one the probability of
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:13:16.853979	275	00:11:36.46	00:11:39.82	when one of the one of the probability of
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060802	276	00:11:39.82	00:11:41.69	choosing a particular distribution is
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060803	277	00:11:41.69	00:11:42.49	equal to 1.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060803	278	00:11:43.42	00:11:45.9	Now that just means we have no
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060803	279	00:11:45.9	00:11:46.69	uncertain it out.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:13:54.982817	279	00:11:45.9	00:11:46.69	uncertainty.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:14:00.377431	279	00:11:45.9	00:11:46.69	uncertainty now.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060804	280	00:11:46.69	00:11:49.68	We just stick with one particular
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060806	281	00:11:49.68	00:11:50.38	distribution.

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060806	283	00:11:54.08	00:11:56.3	this is no longer mixture model 'cause

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060808	288	00:12:05.285	00:12:09.07	case of estimating one word

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060808	290	00:12:12.79	00:12:13.98	So that's the connection that we
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060809	291	00:12:13.98	00:12:14.89	discussed earlier.

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:14:14.663392	292	00:12:15.62	00:12:17.31	But now you can see more clearly.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060809	293	00:12:18.55	00:12:21.27	So as more cases of using a generative
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06081	294	00:12:21.27	00:12:23.45	model to solve a problem, we first look
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06081	295	00:12:23.45	00:12:25.7225	at data and then think about how to
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:14:21.483828	295	00:12:23.45	00:12:25.7225	at theta and then think about how to

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060811	298	00:12:28.73	00:12:30.36	is to write down the likelihood
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060811	299	00:12:30.36	00:12:30.84	function.

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:14:33.202149	300	00:12:31.54	00:12:33.68	And after that we can do is to look at the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060812	301	00:12:33.68	00:12:35.14	how to estimate the parameters.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060812	302	00:12:36.11	00:12:37.65	I saw in this case what's the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:14:41.046141	302	00:12:36.11	00:12:37.65	so in this case what's the

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060813	305	00:12:41.23	00:12:43.35	before in topic models, but it will be
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060813	306	00:12:43.35	00:12:44.13	also different.

8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060826	352	00:14:39.95	00:14:43.026666	So this form should be very similar to
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060826	353	00:14:43.026666	00:14:45.86	the topic model, but it's also useful
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060826	354	00:14:45.86	00:14:48.07	to think about the difference and for
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060827	355	00:14:48.07	00:14:51.17	that purpose I am also copying the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060827	356	00:14:51.17	00:14:52.74	probability of.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060827	357	00:14:53.39	00:14:56.26	Popping model is 2 components here.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:17:19.475771	357	00:14:53.39	00:14:56.26	topic model is two components here.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:17:32.777285	357	00:14:53.39	00:14:56.26	topic model with two components here.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060827	358	00:14:56.26	00:14:58.71	So here you can see at the formula
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060828	359	00:14:58.71	00:15:00.9	looks very similar or in many ways they
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060828	360	00:15:00.9	00:15:01.46	are similar.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060828	361	00:15:02.41	00:15:05.16	But there's also some difference.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060829	362	00:15:06	00:15:08.47	And in particular, the differences on
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060829	363	00:15:08.47	00:15:11.57	the top you see for the mixture model,
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060829	364	00:15:11.57	00:15:13.859999	document clustering, we first take a
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060829	365	00:15:13.86	00:15:15.72	product and then take a sum.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06083	366	00:15:16.51	00:15:18.82	And that's corresponding to our
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06083	367	00:15:18.82	00:15:21.37	assumption of 1st make a choice of
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.06083	368	00:15:21.37	00:15:23.163333	choosing one this vision and then stay
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:17:54.773834	368	00:15:21.37	00:15:23.163333	choosing one distribution and then stay
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060831	369	00:15:23.163333	00:15:25.81	with this religion with all the words.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:18:05.848366	369	00:15:23.163333	00:15:25.81	with this distribution with all the words.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:18:15.950671	369	00:15:23.163333	00:15:25.81	with this distribution to generate all the words.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060831	370	00:15:25.81	00:15:28.32	And that's why we had the product
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060831	371	00:15:28.32	00:15:29.41	inside the sun.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:18:21.439731	371	00:15:28.32	00:15:29.41	inside the sum.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060831	372	00:15:30.81	00:15:32.71	The sum corresponds to the choice.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060832	373	00:15:33.39	00:15:33.73	I.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:18:25.574262	373	00:15:33.39	00:15:33.73	right.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060832	374	00:15:34.93	00:15:37.25	Now in the topic model, we see that the
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060832	375	00:15:37.25	00:15:40.03	Sun is actually inside the product and
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:18:31.973646	375	00:15:37.25	00:15:40.03	sum is actually inside the product and
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060833	376	00:15:40.03	00:15:42.27	that's be cause we generated each word
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060833	377	00:15:42.27	00:15:43.23	independently.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060833	378	00:15:44.64	00:15:46.46	And that's why we have the product
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060833	379	00:15:46.46	00:15:47.26	outside.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060834	380	00:15:47.26	00:15:49.69	But when we generate each each word, we
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060834	381	00:15:49.69	00:15:51.62	have to make a decision regarding which
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060834	382	00:15:51.62	00:15:52.58	distribution we use.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060834	383	00:15:52.58	00:15:55.14	So we have some there for each word.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:18:43.987787	383	00:15:52.58	00:15:55.14	So we have sum there for each word.
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060835	384	00:15:56.65	00:15:58.915	But in general, ideas are all mixture
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060835	385	00:15:58.915	00:16:01.35	models and we can estimate these models
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-24 10:19:02.287508	385	00:15:58.915	00:16:01.35	models that we can estimate these models
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060835	386	00:16:01.35	00:16:03.74	by using the EM algorithm as we will
8717e27a-33fb-4d06-ae68-2e0d915b1568	2020-11-02 23:09:48.060835	387	00:16:03.74	00:16:04.83	discuss more later.

8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027779	5	00:00:15.866666	00:00:17.78	In particular, we're going to introduce
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.02778	6	00:00:17.78	00:00:20.14	a mixture of unigram language models.
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.02778	7	00:00:20.88	00:00:23.33	This is a slide that you have seen
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.02778	8	00:00:23.33	00:00:26.45	earlier where we talked about how to
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.02778	9	00:00:26.45	00:00:29.44	get rid of the background words that

8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027781	13	00:00:39.29	00:00:42.25	I will be useful to think about why we
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-12-10 17:47:04.998061	13	00:00:39.29	00:00:42.25	It will be useful to think about why we
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027781	14	00:00:42.25	00:00:43.58	end up having this problem.
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027781	15	00:00:43.58	00:00:46.436666	Well, this is obviously cause these
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-12-10 17:47:18.271482	15	00:00:43.58	00:00:46.436666	Well, this is obviously because these
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027781	16	00:00:46.436666	00:00:49.205	words are very frequent in our data and
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027781	17	00:00:49.205	00:00:51.65	we are using a maximum likelihood
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027781	18	00:00:51.65	00:00:53.7	estimate and then the estimator
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027781	19	00:00:53.7	00:00:55.25	obviously would have to assign high
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027782	20	00:00:55.25	00:00:57.17	probabilities for these words in order
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027782	21	00:00:57.17	00:00:58.75	to maximize the likelihood.
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027782	22	00:00:59.55	00:01:01.8	So in order to get rid of them, that
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027782	23	00:01:01.8	00:01:03.39	would mean we have to do something
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027782	24	00:01:03.39	00:01:04.17	different here.
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027782	25	00:01:04.99	00:01:07.855	In particular, we have to say that this
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027782	26	00:01:07.855	00:01:09.92	distribution doesn't have to explain
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027783	27	00:01:09.92	00:01:12.3	all the words in the text data, or
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027783	28	00:01:12.3	00:01:14.47	we're going to say these common words
8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027783	29	00:01:14.47	00:01:17.95	should not be explained by this

8eaf2971-31ff-40b7-9fc6-b91c7637f916	2020-11-02 23:14:02.027802	166	00:06:35.48	00:06:37.67	model, it's just like any other

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-29 03:48:47.202325	79	00:03:18.78	00:03:21.1	This idea, however, doesn't work,

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580773	84	00:03:28.99	00:03:32.3125	we can guess which word is from which.
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580774	85	00:03:32.3125	00:03:33.27	It is rich.

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580778	99	00:04:10.7	00:04:12.42	which distribution has been used to

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580779	102	00:04:17.07	00:04:19.68	typical Bayesian inference situation

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580779	104	00:04:23.27	00:04:25.98	These two distributions so can you see
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580779	105	00:04:25.98	00:04:28.033333	what is our prior here?
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.58078	106	00:04:28.033333	00:04:31.8	The player here is the probability of

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.58078	107	00:04:31.8	00:04:33.44	each distribution, right?
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.58078	108	00:04:33.44	00:04:36.95	So the prior is given by these two
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.58078	109	00:04:36.95	00:04:37.9	probabilities.

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-29 03:51:56.576486	110	00:04:37.9	00:04:40.14	In this case the prior is
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580781	111	00:04:41.7	00:04:43.99	Saying that each model is equally

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580781	113	00:04:46.3	00:04:47.6	different price possible.
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-29 03:52:12.79165	113	00:04:46.3	00:04:47.6	different prior possible.
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580782	114	00:04:48.26	00:04:50.62	So this is called prior to cause this
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-29 03:52:26.422664	114	00:04:48.26	00:04:50.62	So this is called prior because this
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580782	115	00:04:50.62	00:04:53.17	is our guess of which distribution has

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-29 03:52:44.456994	118	00:04:57.7225	00:05:00.44	So that's why we call it prior.
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580783	119	00:05:01.32	00:05:03.693333	I see if we don't observe the world or

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580784	120	00:05:03.693333	00:05:05.27	we don't know what word has been

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580784	122	00:05:07.08	00:05:07.62	well.
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580784	123	00:05:08.55	00:05:09.65	They are equally likely.
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580785	124	00:05:10.23	00:05:11.53	Alright, so it's just a flipping a
93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580785	125	00:05:11.53	00:05:11.94	coin.

93efd70b-16b1-45f1-9c81-c0f2aeb7c9ee	2020-11-02 23:15:08.580786	130	00:05:20.28	00:05:23.19	While the evidence here is the word

95f92696-1963-4307-83c6-a8370ff03b30	2020-11-02 22:54:19.681237	123	00:04:57	00:04:59.59	that require contextual text mining

95f92696-1963-4307-83c6-a8370ff03b30	2020-11-24 18:07:30.822499	124	00:04:59.59	00:05:01.58	here, I list some very specific ones.
95f92696-1963-4307-83c6-a8370ff03b30	2020-11-02 22:54:19.681238	125	00:05:01.58	00:05:03.96	For example, what topics have been
95f92696-1963-4307-83c6-a8370ff03b30	2020-11-02 22:54:19.681238	126	00:05:03.96	00:05:05.555	gaining increasing attention recently
95f92696-1963-4307-83c6-a8370ff03b30	2020-11-02 22:54:19.681238	127	00:05:05.555	00:05:07.06	in data mining research?

95f92696-1963-4307-83c6-a8370ff03b30	2020-11-02 22:54:19.681241	132	00:05:17.35	00:05:18.67	Is there any difference in the
95f92696-1963-4307-83c6-a8370ff03b30	2020-11-02 22:54:19.681241	133	00:05:18.67	00:05:20.14	responses of people in different

95f92696-1963-4307-83c6-a8370ff03b30	2020-11-02 22:54:19.681242	136	00:05:24.87	00:05:26.39	question, in this case, of course,
95f92696-1963-4307-83c6-a8370ff03b30	2020-11-02 22:54:19.681242	137	00:05:26.39	00:05:27.88	location is the context.

9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069154	31	00:01:23.465	00:01:25.815	problems, as these problems also occur
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069155	32	00:01:25.815	00:01:28.27	in text retrieval when we match a query

9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069166	50	00:02:05.85	00:02:07.13	So now we're going to talk about the
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069166	51	00:02:07.13	00:02:10.19	two heuristics in more detail.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069167	52	00:02:10.19	00:02:12.96	First, let's talk about the TF
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069167	53	00:02:12.96	00:02:13.735	transformation.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069168	54	00:02:13.735	00:02:16.42	That is, to convert the raw count of
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069169	55	00:02:16.42	00:02:19.49	word in the document into some weight
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069169	56	00:02:19.49	00:02:23.9	that reflects our belief about how
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.06917	57	00:02:23.9	00:02:26.56	important this word in the document.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069171	58	00:02:27.11	00:02:31.4975	And so that will be denoted by TF of
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069171	59	00:02:31.4975	00:02:36.25	W&D as shown in the Y access.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 11:16:37.138745	59	00:02:31.4975	00:02:36.25	W&D as shown in the Y axis.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069172	60	00:02:36.25	00:02:38.19	Now in general there are many ways to
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069173	61	00:02:38.19	00:02:41.38	map that, and let's first look at the
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069173	62	00:02:41.38	00:02:44.41	simple way of mapping and then.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 08:41:48.432213	62	00:02:41.38	00:02:44.41	simple way of mapping.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069174	63	00:02:44.41	00:02:48.17	In this case, we're going to say any
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 11:16:56.205374	63	00:02:44.41	00:02:48.17	In this case, we're going to say, any
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069174	64	00:02:48.17	00:02:51.53	non zero counts will be mapped to one.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069175	65	00:02:53.12	00:02:55.298	And then zero count will be mapped to
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069176	66	00:02:55.298	00:02:55.6	0.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069177	67	00:02:55.6	00:02:58.23	So with this mapping, all the
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069177	68	00:02:58.23	00:03:00.69	frequencies will be mapped to only two
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069178	69	00:03:00.69	00:03:04.12	values, zero or one, and the mapping
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069178	70	00:03:04.12	00:03:09.055	function is shown here as a flat line
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069179	71	00:03:09.055	00:03:10.13	here.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.06918	72	00:03:10.91	00:03:14.64	Right now this is not even because it
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 08:42:50.135578	72	00:03:10.91	00:03:14.64	Now this is naive because it
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.06918	73	00:03:14.64	00:03:16.79	ignored the frequency of words.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069181	74	00:03:16.79	00:03:18.64	However, this actually has the
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069181	75	00:03:18.64	00:03:23.65	advantage of emphasizing matching all
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069182	76	00:03:23.65	00:03:26.73	the words in the context, so it does
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069182	77	00:03:26.73	00:03:29.506666	not allow a frequent word to dominate
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069183	78	00:03:29.506666	00:03:30.399999	the matching.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069184	79	00:03:30.399999	00:03:32.99	Now the approach that we have taken
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069184	80	00:03:32.99	00:03:35.88	earlier in the expected overlap account
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069185	81	00:03:35.88	00:03:38.005	approach is a linear transformation.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069185	82	00:03:38.005	00:03:41.83	We basically take Y as the same as X.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069186	83	00:03:41.98	00:03:43.92	So we use the raw count as
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069186	84	00:03:43.92	00:03:44.77	representation.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069187	85	00:03:45.78	00:03:48.67	And that created the problem that we
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069188	86	00:03:48.67	00:03:49.64	just talked about.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069189	87	00:03:49.64	00:03:52.69	Namely it answers too much on just
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069189	88	00:03:52.69	00:03:55.76	matching one frequent term matching one
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 08:44:07.147917	88	00:03:52.69	00:03:55.76	matching one frequent term. Matching one
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.06919	89	00:03:55.76	00:03:57.8	frequent home can contribute a lot.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 08:43:51.590586	89	00:03:55.76	00:03:57.8	frequent term can contribute a lot.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.06919	90	00:03:59.33	00:04:03.28	So we can have a lot of other
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069191	91	00:04:03.28	00:04:05.4	interesting transformations in between
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069192	92	00:04:05.4	00:04:06.47	the two extremes.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069192	93	00:04:07.23	00:04:09.44	And they generally form a sub linear
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069193	94	00:04:09.44	00:04:10.17	transformation.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069193	95	00:04:10.98	00:04:13.18	So for example, one possibility is to
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069194	96	00:04:13.18	00:04:16.39	take logarithm of the raw count, and
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069194	97	00:04:16.39	00:04:18.92	this will give us curve that looks like
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069195	98	00:04:18.92	00:04:19.71	this, right?
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069195	99	00:04:19.71	00:04:20.78	That you're seeing here.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069196	100	00:04:21.51	00:04:23.71	In this case, you can see the high
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069197	101	00:04:23.71	00:04:24.836666	frequency counts.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 11:18:42.111574	101	00:04:23.71	00:04:24.836666	frequency counts,
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069197	102	00:04:24.836666	00:04:28.48	The high count are penalized a little
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 08:45:21.174757	102	00:04:24.836666	00:04:28.48	The high counts are penalized a little
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 11:18:48.561051	102	00:04:24.836666	00:04:28.48	the high counts are penalized a little
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069198	103	00:04:28.48	00:04:29.46	bit right?
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069199	104	00:04:29.46	00:04:31.94	So the curve is a sub linear curve, an
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069199	105	00:04:31.94	00:04:35.085	it brings down the weight of.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 08:45:44.115853	105	00:04:31.94	00:04:35.085	it brings down the weight of
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.0692	106	00:04:35.085	00:04:38.429999	Really those really high counts.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 08:45:37.56839	106	00:04:35.085	00:04:38.429999	really those really high counts.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.0692	107	00:04:39.66	00:04:41.37	And this is what we want, because it
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069201	108	00:04:41.37	00:04:44.11	prevents that kind of terms from
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069202	109	00:04:44.11	00:04:46.46	dominating the scoring function.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069202	110	00:04:49.61	00:04:51.96	Now there is also another interesting
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069203	111	00:04:51.96	00:04:54.17	transformation called a PM 25
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 08:46:14.506361	111	00:04:51.96	00:04:54.17	transformation called a BM25
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069203	112	00:04:54.17	00:04:57.66	transformation which has been shown to
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069204	113	00:04:57.66	00:05:00.6	be very effective for retrieval and in
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069205	114	00:05:00.6	00:05:03.62	this transformation we have a form

9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069273	240	00:10:33.47	00:10:36.08	But now with the BM 25 transformation,
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069273	241	00:10:36.08	00:10:37.66	we introduced something else.

9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069317	340	00:15:07.106666	00:15:09.75	That means the words that are common,
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069317	341	00:15:09.75	00:15:11.685	like the will get penalized.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 10:02:44.901031	341	00:15:09.75	00:15:11.685	like 'the' will get penalized.

9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069318	343	00:15:14.23125	00:15:16.58	not be those common terms because they
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069319	344	00:15:16.58	00:15:18.43	have lower ideas.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 10:02:57.575933	344	00:15:16.58	00:15:18.43	have lower IDFs.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069319	345	00:15:18.43	00:15:21.814	Instead, those terms would be the terms
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.06932	346	00:15:21.814	00:15:24.38	that are frequent in the context, but
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.06932	347	00:15:24.38	00:15:26.1	not frequently in the collection.

9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069321	349	00:15:28.53	00:15:31.27	tend to occur in the context of the

9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069322	352	00:15:36.38	00:15:39.56	terms in this idea of weighted vector.

9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-24 11:42:01.982009	355	00:15:45.97	00:15:48.28	Now of course, this is only a bi-product
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069323	356	00:15:48.28	00:15:51.48	of our approach for discovering

9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069326	362	00:16:05.33	00:16:09.03	between discovering the two relations.
9a443634-7f2e-4d3a-9ccd-0f1b6604c939	2020-11-02 23:06:23.069327	363	00:16:09.03	00:16:11.54	An indeed they can be discussed,

9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794088	222	00:09:15.26	00:09:16.7	also have two probabilities

9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-27 23:32:40.099136	231	00:09:33.59	00:09:36.37	Right, so this sums to 1 cause.
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-27 23:32:43.005897	231	00:09:33.59	00:09:36.37	Right, so this sums to 1 because
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794092	232	00:09:36.95	00:09:39.7	The two words can only have these four

9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794092	233	00:09:39.7	00:09:40.95	possible scenarios.
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794092	234	00:09:40.95	00:09:42.82	Either they both occur.
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794093	235	00:09:43.46	00:09:45.56	So in that case both variables will
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794093	236	00:09:45.56	00:09:48.79	have a value of one or one of them
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794093	237	00:09:48.79	00:09:49.46	occurs.
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794094	238	00:09:49.46	00:09:50.69	There are two scenarios.
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794094	239	00:09:51.51	00:09:54.05	In these two cases, one of the random
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794095	240	00:09:54.05	00:09:56.03	variables will be equal to 1 and the
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794095	241	00:09:56.03	00:09:57.3725	other would be 0.
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794096	242	00:09:57.3725	00:10:01.61	And finally we have the scenario when
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794096	243	00:10:01.61	00:10:03.19	none of them occurs.
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794096	244	00:10:03.19	00:10:05.15	So this is when the two variables
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794097	245	00:10:05.15	00:10:06.61	taking a value of 0.
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794097	246	00:10:07.34	00:10:08.9	And there's something well, so these
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-27 23:33:31.218612	246	00:10:07.34	00:10:08.9	And they're summing up to 1, so these
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794097	247	00:10:08.9	00:10:10.8	are the probabilities involved in the
9e5a0c5f-ff4a-42a6-b37b-f43628632860	2020-11-02 23:05:13.794098	248	00:10:10.8	00:10:12.49	calculation of mutual information.

aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738085	89	00:03:55.789	00:03:56.494	contradictory.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738086	90	00:03:56.494	00:03:57.859	So all these.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738086	91	00:03:58.009	00:04:01.239	Problems with this approach, and it
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738087	92	00:04:01.239	00:04:03.869	turns out that the both problems can be

aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.73809	101	00:04:23.999	00:04:26.319	experts to help in two ways.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738091	102	00:04:26.319	00:04:28.929	First, the human experts must annotate
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738091	103	00:04:28.929	00:04:31.539	datasets with category labels, will
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738091	104	00:04:31.539	00:04:33.619	tell the computer which documents

aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738092	106	00:04:36.409	00:04:38.404	And this is called a training data.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738093	107	00:04:38.404	00:04:41.309	And then Secondly the human experts
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738093	108	00:04:41.309	00:04:43.259	also need to provide a set of features
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738093	109	00:04:43.259	00:04:46.909	to represent each text object that can

aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738095	112	00:04:49.729	00:04:52.889	So we need to provide some basic
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738095	113	00:04:52.889	00:04:54.739	features for the computers to look

aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738096	115	00:04:55.779	00:04:58.399	And in the case of text, natural choice
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738096	116	00:04:58.399	00:04:59.339	would be the words.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738096	117	00:04:59.339	00:05:02.939	So using each word as a feature is a
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738097	118	00:05:02.939	00:05:05.469	very common choice to start with.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738097	119	00:05:05.469	00:05:07.089	But of course there are other surface
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-12-02 06:14:26.300977	119	00:05:05.469	00:05:07.089	But of course there are other sophisticated
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738097	120	00:05:07.089	00:05:08.969	to get the features like a phrases or
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-12-02 06:14:28.845364	120	00:05:07.089	00:05:08.969	features like a phrases or
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-12-02 06:14:38.805552	120	00:05:07.089	00:05:08.969	features like phrases or
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738098	121	00:05:08.969	00:05:11.419	even policy which tags or even
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-12-02 06:15:24.750001	121	00:05:08.969	00:05:11.419	even policy feature tags or even
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738098	122	00:05:11.419	00:05:12.749	syntactic structures.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738098	123	00:05:12.749	00:05:15.919	So once human experts can provide this,
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738099	124	00:05:15.919	00:05:17.359	then we can use machine learning to
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738099	125	00:05:17.359	00:05:20.549	learn soft rules for categorization
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738099	126	00:05:20.549	00:05:21.7715	from the training data.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.7381	127	00:05:21.7715	00:05:24.939	So soft rules just means we're going to
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.7381	128	00:05:24.939	00:05:26.759	still decide which category should be
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738101	129	00:05:26.759	00:05:27.869	assigned to the document.

aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738102	131	00:05:30.259	00:05:33.969	rule that is deterministic, so we might
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738103	132	00:05:33.969	00:05:37.389	use something similar to saying that if
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738103	133	00:05:37.389	00:05:39.959	it matches game sports many times, it's
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738103	134	00:05:39.959	00:05:41.309	likely to be a sports.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738103	135	00:05:41.309	00:05:43.799	But we're not going to say exactly for
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738104	136	00:05:43.799	00:05:45.299	sure, but instead we're going to use
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738104	137	00:05:45.299	00:05:48.069	probabilities or weights so that we can
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738104	138	00:05:48.069	00:05:51.129	combine multiple evidences, so the
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738104	139	00:05:51.129	00:05:52.789	learning process basically is going to
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738105	140	00:05:52.789	00:05:54.189	figure out which features are most
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738105	141	00:05:54.189	00:05:55.759	useful for separating different
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738105	142	00:05:55.759	00:05:56.479	categories.

aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738106	147	00:06:05.839	00:06:08.179	as you can see very important.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738107	148	00:06:08.799	00:06:10.159	It's the basis for learning.
aac4e33c-97bb-46c8-a108-3e3e3322a85c	2020-11-02 23:16:02.738107	149	00:06:10.869	00:06:12.759	And then the A classifier can be

aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963488	17	00:00:49.61	00:00:52.82	So a more general picture would be to
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963488	18	00:00:52.82	00:00:55.1	include non text data as well.

aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963499	45	00:02:00.5175	00:02:03.63	the world and that can be called the
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.9635	46	00:02:03.63	00:02:04.13	observed.

aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963501	49	00:02:07.24	00:02:08.85	the real world because of the
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963501	50	00:02:08.85	00:02:12.04	perspective that the person has taken.

aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963504	58	00:02:35.14	00:02:39.07	a person has in mind about the world,
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963505	59	00:02:39.07	00:02:41.67	and we don't really know what exactly
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963505	60	00:02:41.67	00:02:43.1	it looks like, of course.
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963506	61	00:02:43.71	00:02:46.955	But then the human would express what
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963506	62	00:02:46.955	00:02:50.69	the person has observed using a natural

aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963507	64	00:02:53.33	00:02:54.92	result is text data.
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963507	65	00:02:55.75	00:02:57.435	Of course, the person could have used a
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963508	66	00:02:57.435	00:03:00.48	different language to express what he
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963508	67	00:03:00.48	00:03:02.01	or she has observed.
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963508	68	00:03:02.01	00:03:04.955	In that case, we might have texted are
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-24 20:49:38.379238	68	00:03:02.01	00:03:04.955	In that case, we might have text data
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963509	69	00:03:04.955	00:03:07.785	of mixed languages for different
aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963509	70	00:03:07.785	00:03:08.31	languages.

aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.96351	72	00:03:12.72	00:03:16.55	actually to revert this process of

aca8d826-412b-4134-8d2c-87537fdc4a76	2020-11-02 22:59:05.963512	77	00:03:29.91	00:03:32.44	the mining, for example, knowledge

b1854d1c-3199-4c42-ab7d-f219f70259a3	2020-11-02 23:19:12.342047	62	00:02:38.36	00:02:41.12	For this kind of service, this price is
b1854d1c-3199-4c42-ab7d-f219f70259a3	2020-11-02 23:19:12.342047	63	00:02:41.12	00:02:44.42	good, so the reviewer might give it a
b1854d1c-3199-4c42-ab7d-f219f70259a3	2020-11-02 23:19:12.342048	64	00:02:44.42	00:02:45.07	five star.

b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765823	6	00:00:19.085	00:00:21.53	the earlier lecture where we defined
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765824	7	00:00:21.53	00:00:24.49	the task of top mining an analysis.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-27 23:46:50.641365	7	00:00:21.53	00:00:24.49	the task of top mining and analysis.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765824	8	00:00:25.04	00:00:27.66	We also raised the question how do we
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765824	9	00:00:27.66	00:00:30.86	exactly define the topic theater?
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-24 19:25:09.786591	9	00:00:27.66	00:00:30.86	exactly define the topic theta?
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765825	10	00:00:31.66	00:00:33.5	So in this lecture were going to offer
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-24 19:25:18.705762	10	00:00:31.66	00:00:33.5	So in this lecture we are going to offer
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765825	11	00:00:33.5	00:00:36.45	one way to define it, and that's our
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765825	12	00:00:36.45	00:00:37.286666	initial idea.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765826	13	00:00:37.286666	00:00:39.94	Our idea here is defining a topic
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-27 23:47:09.338587	13	00:00:37.286666	00:00:39.94	Our idea here is to define a topic
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765826	14	00:00:39.94	00:00:41.18	simply as a term.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765826	15	00:00:41.88	00:00:44.26	A term can be a word or a phrase.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765828	16	00:00:45.13	00:00:48.115	An in general, we can use these terms
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-24 19:25:34.851904	16	00:00:45.13	00:00:48.115	And in general, we can use these terms
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765828	17	00:00:48.115	00:00:50.5	to describe topics, so our first
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765829	18	00:00:50.5	00:00:53.05	thought is just to define a topic as
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765829	19	00:00:53.05	00:00:54.08	one term.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765829	20	00:00:54.08	00:00:56.26	For example, we might have terms like
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.76583	21	00:00:56.26	00:00:56.81	sports.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-27 23:47:26.489173	21	00:00:56.26	00:00:56.81	sports,
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.76583	22	00:00:57.38	00:00:59.65	Travel or science as you see here.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-27 23:47:29.423687	22	00:00:57.38	00:00:59.65	travel or science as you see here.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.76583	23	00:01:00.78	00:01:03.525	Now if we define a topic in this way,
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765831	24	00:01:03.525	00:01:06.85	we can analyze the coverage of such
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765831	25	00:01:06.85	00:01:09.05	topics in each document.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765831	26	00:01:09.05	00:01:11.71	Here, for example, we might want to
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765831	27	00:01:11.71	00:01:14.25	discover toward extend document one
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-24 19:26:15.982974	27	00:01:11.71	00:01:14.25	discover to what extent document 1
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765832	28	00:01:14.25	00:01:17.285	covers sports and we found that 30% of
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765832	29	00:01:17.285	00:01:19.8	the content of documents about sports.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-24 19:26:40.752896	29	00:01:17.285	00:01:19.8	the content of document 1 is about sports.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765833	30	00:01:20.47	00:01:23.55	And 12% is about the travel etc.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765833	31	00:01:23.55	00:01:26.9	We might also discover Document 2 does
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765833	32	00:01:26.9	00:01:29.31	not cover sports at all, so the
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765834	33	00:01:29.31	00:01:31.45	coverage is zero, etc.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765834	34	00:01:32.53	00:01:35.24	So now of course, as we discussed.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765834	35	00:01:36.76	00:01:40.04	In the task definition for topic mining
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765834	36	00:01:40.04	00:01:43.6625	and analysis, we have two tasks, one to
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-24 19:27:17.910792	36	00:01:40.04	00:01:43.6625	and analysis, we have two tasks, one is to
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765835	37	00:01:43.6625	00:01:46.96	discover the topics and the 2nd is to
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765835	38	00:01:46.96	00:01:48.06	analyze the coverage.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765835	39	00:01:48.06	00:01:50.23	So let's first think about how we can
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765836	40	00:01:50.23	00:01:53.475	discover topics if we represent each
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765836	41	00:01:53.475	00:01:54.42	topic by a term.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765836	42	00:01:54.42	00:01:58.05	So that means we need to mine K topical
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765837	43	00:01:58.05	00:01:59.53	terms from a collection.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765837	44	00:02:00.93	00:02:03.25	Now there are of course many different
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765837	45	00:02:03.25	00:02:04.78	ways of doing that an.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-24 19:27:42.199532	45	00:02:03.25	00:02:04.78	ways of doing that and.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765838	46	00:02:05.59	00:02:07.47	We're going to talk about a natural way
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765838	47	00:02:07.47	00:02:09.87	of the net, which is also likely
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-24 19:27:53.257447	47	00:02:07.47	00:02:09.87	of doing that, which is also likely
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765838	48	00:02:09.87	00:02:10.58	effective.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765838	49	00:02:10.58	00:02:12.55	So first we're going to pause the text
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-24 19:28:09.359949	49	00:02:10.58	00:02:12.55	So first we're going to parse the text
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765839	50	00:02:12.55	00:02:14.7	data in the collection to obtain

b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765876	180	00:07:29.33	00:07:31.46	idea for solving problem, we have to
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765876	181	00:07:31.46	00:07:34.25	ask the question, how good is this one?
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765876	182	00:07:34.25	00:07:37.06	Or is this the best way of solving the
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765877	183	00:07:37.06	00:07:37.37	problem?

b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765877	185	00:07:40.67	00:07:43.63	In general, we have to do some

b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765881	199	00:08:22.44	00:08:25.78	So the count of sports is zero.
b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765881	200	00:08:25.78	00:08:29.26	That means the coverage of sports will

b75d0d2e-a1b7-4f6a-b699-f81ec4b720c7	2020-11-02 23:11:16.765885	212	00:08:50.79	00:08:54.2	What's worse, term travel actually

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640507	19	00:00:59.255	00:01:00.34	the context.
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640507	20	00:01:01.49	00:01:04.13	And you can see we are seeing some
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640507	21	00:01:04.13	00:01:07.11	remaining words in the sentences that
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640507	22	00:01:07.11	00:01:08.13	contain cat.
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640507	23	00:01:09.48	00:01:11.41	Now we can do the same thing for
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640508	24	00:01:11.41	00:01:12.67	another word like a dog.
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640508	25	00:01:13.54	00:01:15.44	So in general we would like to capture
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640508	26	00:01:15.44	00:01:18.13	such a context and then try to assess
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640508	27	00:01:18.13	00:01:20.66	the similarity of the context of cat
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640509	28	00:01:20.66	00:01:23.45	and the context of award like dog.
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-24 05:28:21.425176	28	00:01:20.66	00:01:23.45	and the context of a word like dog.
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640509	29	00:01:24.69	00:01:27.09	So now the question is, how can we
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640509	30	00:01:27.09	00:01:30.15	formally represent the context and then
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640509	31	00:01:30.15	00:01:31.9	define the similarity function?
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.64051	32	00:01:33.21	00:01:35.91	So first we note that the context
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.64051	33	00:01:35.91	00:01:37.85	actually contains a lot of words.
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.64051	34	00:01:38.43	00:01:41.41	So they can be regarded as a pseudo
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.64051	35	00:01:41.41	00:01:42.12	document.

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640511	38	00:01:47.21	00:01:48.64	looking at the context.
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640511	39	00:01:48.64	00:01:52.21	For example, we can look at the word
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640511	40	00:01:52.21	00:01:55.011538	that occurs before the world cat.

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640512	41	00:01:55.011538	00:01:56.287692	We can call.

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-24 05:29:31.197172	42	00:01:56.287692	00:01:59.07	We can call this context left1
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640512	43	00:01:59.07	00:02:00.015	context.

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640513	45	00:02:02.44	00:02:07.08	like, am I, his or big, a, the, etc.

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640513	46	00:02:07.08	00:02:10.825555	These are the words that can occur to
b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640513	47	00:02:10.825555	00:02:12.238888	the left of the world cat.

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640513	49	00:02:15.85	00:02:17.6	A cat etc.

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-24 05:34:09.785236	54	00:02:27.91	00:02:32.27	And here we see words eats, ate, is, has,

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640575	272	00:11:50.95	00:11:52.91	test it, approach it with real data and

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640575	274	00:11:55.54	00:11:58.48	related words really give us a

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640576	277	00:12:03.27	00:12:05.1	this formula little bit.

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640577	280	00:12:09.86	00:12:12.02	'cause this formula will give a higher

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640578	284	00:12:18.23	00:12:20.459999	But if you analyze the formula more

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.64058	292	00:12:37.735	00:12:41.28	the dot product, if one element has a

b9eb5a35-5bad-4cf5-9d94-b0b0c816c8cf	2020-11-02 23:03:08.640581	294	00:12:44.99	00:12:48.28	by both context and it contributes a

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613645	62	00:02:42.9	00:02:47.188181	kind of remember the normalizer or the

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613645	64	00:02:49.702727	00:02:52.878571	So in this case we know the constraint
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613646	65	00:02:52.878571	00:02:56.09	on this probability in the E step is
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613646	66	00:02:56.09	00:03:00.3	that all the probabilities of Z equals

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613648	71	00:03:09.71	00:03:11.63	from each of them should sum to one.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613648	72	00:03:12.13	00:03:15.8	And if this constraint then you can
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613648	73	00:03:15.8	00:03:18.57	easy to compute this distribution as
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613648	74	00:03:18.57	00:03:20.4	long as.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613649	75	00:03:21.88	00:03:24.37	What it is proportional to, right?
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:11:52.02177	75	00:03:21.88	00:03:24.37	what it is proportional to, right?

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61365	77	00:03:27.315	00:03:29.955	you see here, then you simply normalize
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61365	78	00:03:29.955	00:03:32.68	this these probabilities to make them
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613651	79	00:03:32.68	00:03:35.12	something what over all the topics.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:12:16.352227	79	00:03:32.68	00:03:35.12	some to 1 what over all the topics.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613651	80	00:03:35.82	00:03:38.665	So that's easy step after eastep over
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:13:17.5202	80	00:03:35.82	00:03:38.665	So that's E step after E Step we would know 
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613651	81	00:03:38.665	00:03:40.77	which distribution is more likely to
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613651	82	00:03:40.77	00:03:43.063333	have generated this document ID, which

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613652	84	00:03:45.18	00:03:46.9	And then in the M step, we're going to
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613652	85	00:03:46.9	00:03:49.23	relist, made all the parameters based

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613656	97	00:04:12.04	00:04:14.219999	is more likely, but after we have
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613657	98	00:04:14.22	00:04:16.83	observed these documents, then we can
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613657	99	00:04:16.83	00:04:18.57	collect the evidence.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613657	100	00:04:20.48	00:04:23.66	To infer which cluster is more likely,
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613658	101	00:04:23.66	00:04:26.08	and so this is proportional to the sum
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613658	102	00:04:26.08	00:04:32.14	of the probability of Z sub DJ is equal

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613659	105	00:04:37.78	00:04:39.735	about using topic.

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61366	108	00:04:45.49	00:04:48.67	normalize them into probabilities.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61366	109	00:04:49.89	00:04:53.59	And then so this is 4 P of Theta sub I.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:14:37.920518	109	00:04:49.89	00:04:53.59	And then so this is for P of Theta sub I.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613661	110	00:04:54.44	00:04:56.47	Now the other kind of parameters are

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613668	129	00:05:47.795	00:05:53.61	to know that distribution is over what?
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613668	130	00:05:54.37	00:05:57.152	For example, the probability of Theta
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613669	131	00:05:57.152	00:05:59.96	is overall the key topics and that's
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613669	132	00:05:59.96	00:06:02	why these capabilities with something
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:17:28.335091	132	00:05:59.96	00:06:02	why these K probabilities sum to 1.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613669	133	00:06:02	00:06:04.44	well, whereas the probability of a word
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613669	134	00:06:04.44	00:06:06.63	given Theta is a probability
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61367	135	00:06:06.63	00:06:08.5	distribution over all the words.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61367	136	00:06:08.5	00:06:10.74	So there are many probabilities and
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61367	137	00:06:10.74	00:06:11.65	they have to send one.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613671	138	00:06:12.62	00:06:14.295	So now let's take a look like this.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613671	139	00:06:14.295	00:06:16.29	Take a look at the simple example of

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613672	141	00:06:17.34	00:06:18.619999	I have two clusters.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613672	142	00:06:18.62	00:06:21.06	I've shown some initializer values for
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613673	143	00:06:21.06	00:06:22.64	the two distributions.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613674	144	00:06:23.32	00:06:25.5	And let's assume we randomly
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613675	145	00:06:25.5	00:06:28.32	initialized to probabilities of

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613675	147	00:06:30.77	00:06:32.03	So equally likely.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613676	148	00:06:33	00:06:35.63	And then let's consider one document
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613676	149	00:06:35.63	00:06:36.576	that you have seen here.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613677	150	00:06:36.576	00:06:38.813333	There are two words, sorry, two
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613677	151	00:06:38.813333	00:06:40.6275	occurrences of text and two occurrences

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613678	154	00:06:44.01	00:06:46.06	Medical and health did not occur in

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613678	156	00:06:48.43	00:06:49.56	about the hidden variables.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613679	157	00:06:50.24	00:06:53.27	Now for each document we must use a
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613679	158	00:06:53.27	00:06:57.36	hidden variable and before in PSA we

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61368	160	00:07:00.35	00:07:03.16	Because that's the output from what
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61368	161	00:07:03.16	00:07:03.7	mixture model.

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613681	163	00:07:06.2	00:07:08.056666	mixture model or the observation from
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613681	164	00:07:08.056666	00:07:09.82	mixture model is a document, another
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:19:13.109623	164	00:07:08.056666	00:07:09.82	mixture model is a document not a

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613682	166	00:07:10.425	00:07:12.76	So now we have 1 hidden variable
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613682	167	00:07:12.76	00:07:14.219999	attached to the document.

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613683	169	00:07:16.85	00:07:18.62	distribution has been used to generate

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613683	171	00:07:20.95	00:07:23.41	values, one and two to indicate the two

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613685	174	00:07:27.67	00:07:29.365	distribution has been used to generate

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613686	177	00:07:32.45	00:07:36.13	this in order for the first topic is
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613686	178	00:07:36.13	00:07:38	setup, want to generate the document.

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613689	188	00:08:02.47	00:08:04.37	the product of the probability of

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613694	204	00:08:41.6	00:08:42.72	1,000,000 one.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613694	205	00:08:43.45	00:08:46.22	So now it's important to note that in
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613694	206	00:08:46.22	00:08:48.71	such a computation there is a potential
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613694	207	00:08:48.71	00:08:51.05	problem of underflow, and that is
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613695	208	00:08:51.05	00:08:52.646666	because if you look at the numerator,
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613695	209	00:08:52.646666	00:08:55.88	the original numerator and denominator
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613695	210	00:08:55.88	00:08:57.47	it involves the computation of a

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613696	212	00:09:00.23	00:09:02.83	Imagine if a document has many words
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613696	213	00:09:02.83	00:09:06	and it's going to be a very small value
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613696	214	00:09:06	00:09:08.296	here, as it can cause the problem of
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613696	215	00:09:08.296	00:09:08.64	underflow.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613697	216	00:09:09.28	00:09:10.91	So to solve the problem.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613697	217	00:09:11.75	00:09:13.62	We can use a normalized.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613697	218	00:09:14.43	00:09:17.62	So here you see that we take average of
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613698	219	00:09:17.62	00:09:20.64	all these two solutions to compute
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613698	220	00:09:20.64	00:09:23.04	another average district called Theater
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613698	221	00:09:23.04	00:09:23.62	Bar.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613698	222	00:09:24.41	00:09:26.82	And this does the average distribution
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613699	223	00:09:26.82	00:09:29.15	will be comperable to each of these
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613699	224	00:09:29.15	00:09:29.97	distributions.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613699	225	00:09:30.59	00:09:32.31	In terms of the quantities, the
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613699	226	00:09:32.31	00:09:32.93	magnitude.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.6137	227	00:09:33.55	00:09:38.355	So we can then divide the numerator and
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.6137	228	00:09:38.355	00:09:40.75	the denominator both by this
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.6137	229	00:09:40.75	00:09:41.53	normalizer.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613701	230	00:09:41.53	00:09:43.49	So basically this normalizes the
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613701	231	00:09:43.49	00:09:47.03	probability of generating this document
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613701	232	00:09:47.03	00:09:50.99	by using this average voter
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:24:08.548339	232	00:09:47.03	00:09:50.99	by using this average word
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613701	233	00:09:50.99	00:09:51.72	distribution.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613702	234	00:09:52.88	00:09:55.18	So you can see the normalizer here.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613702	235	00:09:56.44	00:09:59.13	And since we have used exact the same
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613702	236	00:09:59.13	00:10:01.22	normalizer for the numerator and
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613702	237	00:10:01.22	00:10:03.64	denominator, the whole value of this
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613703	238	00:10:03.64	00:10:05.64	expression is not changed.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613703	239	00:10:06.21	00:10:08.19	But by doing this normalization you can
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613703	240	00:10:08.19	00:10:11.23	see we can make the numerators and
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613703	241	00:10:11.23	00:10:15.1	denominators more manageable in that
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613704	242	00:10:15.1	00:10:17.12	the overall value is not going to be
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613704	243	00:10:17.12	00:10:21.1	very small for each, and thus we can
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613704	244	00:10:21.1	00:10:22.87	avoid underflow problem.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613704	245	00:10:24.46	00:10:26.39	In some other times we sometimes also
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613705	246	00:10:26.39	00:10:30.33	use logarithm of the product to convert
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613705	247	00:10:30.33	00:10:32.41	this into a sum of log of
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613705	248	00:10:32.41	00:10:33.4	probabilities.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613705	249	00:10:33.4	00:10:35.464	This can help preserve precision as
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613706	250	00:10:35.464	00:10:38.12	well, but in this case we cannot use
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613706	251	00:10:38.12	00:10:40.97	logarithms to solve the problem because
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613706	252	00:10:40.97	00:10:43.89	there's some in the denominator, But
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:25:10.43535	252	00:10:40.97	00:10:43.89	there's sum in the denominator, But
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613706	253	00:10:43.89	00:10:47.22	this kind of normalizes can be
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613706	254	00:10:47.22	00:10:49.35	effective for solving this problem, so
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613707	255	00:10:49.35	00:10:52.28	it's a technique that's sometimes
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613707	256	00:10:52.28	00:10:54.04	useful in other situations as well.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613707	257	00:10:55.14	00:10:56.6	Now let's look at the M step.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613708	258	00:10:56.6	00:10:59.32	So from the E step we can see our
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613708	259	00:10:59.32	00:11:01.256666	estimate of which distribution is more
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613708	260	00:11:01.256666	00:11:03.14	likely to have generated a document,
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613708	261	00:11:03.14	00:11:06.21	and you can see the wise more likely
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:26:01.505099	261	00:11:03.14	00:11:06.21	and you can see D1 is more likely
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613709	262	00:11:06.21	00:11:07.98	from the first topic.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613709	263	00:11:07.98	00:11:09.78	Where is D2 is more like from the
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613709	264	00:11:09.78	00:11:11.2	second topic, etc.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613709	265	00:11:11.96	00:11:14.139999	Now let's think about what we need to
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613709	266	00:11:14.14	00:11:15.76	compute in the M step.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61371	267	00:11:15.76	00:11:17.41	Basically we need to re estimate all
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61371	268	00:11:17.41	00:11:18.16	the parameters.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61371	269	00:11:18.16	00:11:20.28	Let's first look at the P of set up one
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:26:21.032113	269	00:11:18.16	00:11:20.28	Let's first look at the P of Theta 1
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61371	270	00:11:20.28	00:11:21.54	and PLC .2.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:26:40.401532	270	00:11:20.28	00:11:21.54	and P of Theta 2.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.61371	271	00:11:22.35	00:11:23.902	How do we estimate that?
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613711	272	00:11:23.902	00:11:26.507142	Intuitively, you can just pull together
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613711	273	00:11:26.507142	00:11:30.749999	the Z probability Z probabilities from
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613711	274	00:11:30.75	00:11:31.735	eastep, right?
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:26:56.625982	274	00:11:30.75	00:11:31.735	E Steps, right?
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613711	275	00:11:31.735	00:11:33.86	So if all these documents say they're
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613711	276	00:11:33.86	00:11:37.076666	more likely from silouan, then we
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613711	277	00:11:37.076666	00:11:39.24	intuitively would give a high

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613712	279	00:11:41.91	00:11:44.68	So in this case, so we can just take
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613712	280	00:11:44.68	00:11:46.653333	the average of these probabilities that

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:27:25.591747	281	00:11:46.653333	00:11:50.32	you see here, and we obtain the .6 for Theta 1
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613712	282	00:11:50.32	00:11:52.319999	so still aligns more likely.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:28:06.483706	282	00:11:50.32	00:11:52.319999	so Theta 1 is more likely 
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613712	283	00:11:52.43	00:11:53.22	And then C .2.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:28:13.619632	283	00:11:52.43	00:11:53.22	Theta 2.

dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-12-08 15:28:47.857138	284	00:11:54.03	00:11:57.32	So you can see the probability of Theta 2
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613713	285	00:11:57.32	00:11:58.8	would be naturally .4.
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613713	286	00:11:59.64	00:12:01.345	What about these world probabilities?
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613713	287	00:12:01.345	00:12:02.7175	What we do the same?
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613713	288	00:12:02.7175	00:12:04.806666	And intuition is the same, so we're
dccc8a84-66da-47ce-ab88-28e8acf192b9	2020-11-02 23:09:28.613714	289	00:12:04.806666	00:12:06.86	going to see in order to estimate the

f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-02 23:11:34.309454	172	00:07:28.31	00:07:31.09	posterior probability and we would have
f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-02 23:11:34.309454	173	00:07:31.09	00:07:32.81	the following formula that you see

f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-02 23:11:34.309456	176	00:07:36.18	00:07:37.69	this case, we're going to choose the
f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-02 23:11:34.309456	177	00:07:37.69	00:07:42.36	theater that has a large P of Theta I.

f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-02 23:11:34.309457	179	00:07:45.37	00:07:47.55	high probability of generating D.
f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-02 23:11:34.309457	180	00:07:47.55	00:07:50.49	So we're going to favor cluster that's
f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-25 05:36:35.906746	180	00:07:47.55	00:07:50.49	So we're going to favor a cluster that's
f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-02 23:11:34.309458	181	00:07:50.49	00:07:54.73	large and also consistent with the

f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-02 23:11:34.309459	185	00:08:01.875	00:08:04.21	a large cluster is generally higher

f64adab4-578a-4868-8b2c-03fdd4ddf55d	2020-11-02 23:11:34.30946	187	00:08:07.53	00:08:09.73	So this means once we can estimate the
