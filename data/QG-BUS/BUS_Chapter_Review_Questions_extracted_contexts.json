      "exhibit 9.3 illustrates this type of situation by presenting a partial cash budget for a hypothetical firm called ­oze - moore . the cash budget shows that , despite its increasing sales , oze - moore will have cash shortages in march and april . knowing this in advance gives financial managers time to find the best sources of short - term financing to cover these shortages . the cash budget also shows that oze - moore will experience a big cash surplus in may as the customers start paying for the purchases they made in march and april .",
      "one of the first steps in getting control over your financial situation is to develop a budget , which is a detailed forecast of your expected cash inflows ( income ) and cash outflows ( expenditures ) . you can use your budget to develop your financial plan and to monitor your progress toward achieving your financial goals .",
      "the cash budget is another important financial planning tool . cash budgets normally cover a one - year period and show projected cash inflows and outflows for each month . financial managers use cash budgets to get a better understanding of the timing of cash flows within the planning period . this is i­mportant because most firms experience uneven inflows and outflows of cash over the course of a year , which can lead to cash shortages and cash surpluses . for example , the video game industry experiences sizable increases in cash flows when sony and microsoft introduce new versions of their playstation and xbox gaming platforms ( typically every 3–4 years ) ; when new blockbuster games ( such as madden nfl ) are released ; and in november and december , during which holiday sales often exceed sales from the rest of the year.7"

      "cash budget a detailed forecast of future cash flows that helps financial managers identify when their firm is likely to experience temporary shortages or surpluses of cash .",
      "financial budgets focus on the firm 's financial goals and identify the resources needed to achieve these goals . the two main financial budget documents are the cash budget and the capital expenditure budget . the cash budget identifies short - term fluctuations in cash flows , helping managers identify times when the firm might face cash flow problems — or when it might have a temporary surplus of cash that it could invest . the capital expenditure budget identifies the firm 's planned investments in major fixed assets and long - term projects . the information from these two financial budgets and the budgeted income statement are combined to construct the budgeted balance sheet . this is the last financial budget ; it shows how the firm 's operations , investing , and financing activities are expected to affect all of the asset , liability , and owners ' equity accounts .",
      "exhibit 9.3 illustrates this type of situation by presenting a partial cash budget for a hypothetical firm called ­oze - moore . the cash budget shows that , despite its increasing sales , oze - moore will have cash shortages in march and april . knowing this in advance gives financial managers time to find the best sources of short - term financing to cover these shortages . the cash budget also shows that oze - moore will experience a big cash surplus in may as the customers start paying for the purchases they made in march and april .",
      "one of the first steps in getting control over your financial situation is to develop a budget , which is a detailed forecast of your expected cash inflows ( income ) and cash outflows ( expenditures ) . you can use your budget to develop your financial plan and to monitor your progress toward achieving your financial goals .",
      "the cash budget is another important financial planning tool . cash budgets normally cover a one - year period and show projected cash inflows and outflows for each month . financial managers use cash budgets to get a better understanding of the timing of cash flows within the planning period . this is i­mportant because most firms experience uneven inflows and outflows of cash over the course of a year , which can lead to cash shortages and cash surpluses . for example , the video game industry experiences sizable increases in cash flows when sony and microsoft introduce new versions of their playstation and xbox gaming platforms ( typically every 3–4 years ) ; when new blockbuster games ( such as madden nfl ) are released ; and in november and december , during which holiday sales often exceed sales from the rest of the year.7"
