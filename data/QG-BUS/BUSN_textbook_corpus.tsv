Not surprisingly, capturing and retaining the attention of customers, employees, and investors is more challenging than ever. In spite of declining attention spans, creating a sense of fun is gaining momentum as an effective tool for engaging audiences. It's fairly easy to understand why—wouldn't you rather do something fun than something boring? Swedish amusement park Liseberg recently released an app to accompany its new Helix roller coaster. Attendees standing in line for the attraction could use the app to play a free Helix-themed game, and every 15 minutes, the player with the highest score got a pass to skip the line.

Digital natives don't feel entitled to a great job when they graduate college; they think they'll be lucky to get one. In the meantime, they are saving their money, only spending when a business offers them value.

While you can certainly recognize a business when you see one, more formal definitions may help as you read through this book. A business is any organization or activity that provides goods and services in an effort to earn a Profit is the financial reward that comes from starting and running a business. More specifically, profit is the money that a business earns in sales (or revenue), minus expenses such as the cost of goods and the cost of salaries. But clearly, not every business earns a profit all the time. When a business brings in less money than it needs to cover expenses, it incurs a loss. If you launch a music label, for instance, you'll need to pay your artists, lease a studio, and purchase equipment, among other expenses. If your label generates hits, you'll earn more than enough to cover all your expenses and make yourself rich. But a series of duds could leave you holding the bag.	while you can certainly recognize a business when you see one , more formal definitions may help as you read through this book . a business is any organization or activity that provides goods and services in an effort to earn a profit is the financial reward that comes from starting and running a business . more specifically , profit is the money that a business earns in sales ( or revenue ) , minus expenses such as the cost of goods and the cost of salaries . but clearly , not every business earns a profit all the time . when a business brings in less money than it needs to cover expenses , it incurs a loss . if you launch a music label , for instance , you 'll need to pay your artists , lease a studio , and purchase equipment , among other expenses . if your label generates hits , you 'll earn more than enough to cover all your expenses and make yourself rich . but a series of duds could leave you holding the bag .

Uber, the largest ride-sharing company, owns no vehicles but connects people to rides and drivers to customers. Airbnb, the largest provider of accommodations, owns no real estate but connects people to lodging. Kickstarter and Indiegogo, both giants of crowdfunding, have no money to invest but may soon surpass traditional venture capital firms by connecting investors to opportunities.

Entrepreneurship: Entrepreneurs are people who take the risk of launching and operating their own businesses, largely in response to the profit incentive. They tend to see opportunities where others don't, and they use their own resources to capitalize on that potential. Entrepreneurial enterprises can kick-start an economy, creating a tidal wave of opportunity by harnessing the other factors of production. But entrepreneurs don't thrive in an environment that doesn't support them. The key ingredient is economic freedom: freedom of choice (whom to hire, for instance, or what to produce), freedom from excess regulation, and freedom from too much taxation. Protection from corruption and unfair competition is another entrepreneurial “must.”	entrepreneurship : entrepreneurs are people who take the risk of launching and operating their own businesses , largely in response to the profit incentive . they tend to see opportunities where others do n't , and they use their own resources to capitalize on that potential . entrepreneurial enterprises can kick - start an economy , creating a tidal wave of opportunity by harnessing the other factors of production . but entrepreneurs do n't thrive in an environment that does n't support them . the key ingredient is economic freedom : freedom of choice ( whom to hire , for instance , or what to produce ) , freedom from excess regulation , and freedom from too much taxation . protection from corruption and unfair competition is another entrepreneurial “ must . ”

As global competition intensifies yet further, leadingedge companies have focused on customer satisfaction like never before. The goal: to develop long-term, mutually beneficial relationships with customers. Getting current customers to buy more of your product is a lot less expensive than convincing potential customers to try your product for the first time. And if you transform your current customers into loyal advocates—vocal promoters of your product or service—they'll get those new customers for you more effectively than any advertising or discount program. Companies such as Amazon, Coca-Cola, and Northwestern Mutual life insurance lead their industries in customer satisfaction, which translates into higher profits even when the competition is tough.13	as global competition intensifies yet further , leadingedge companies have focused on customer satisfaction like never before . the goal : to develop long - term , mutually beneficial relationships with customers . getting current customers to buy more of your product is a lot less expensive than convincing potential customers to try your product for the first time . and if you transform your current customers into loyal advocates — vocal promoters of your product or service — they'll get those new customers for you more effectively than any advertising or discount program . companies such as amazon , coca - cola , and northwestern mutual life insurance lead their industries in customer satisfaction , which translates into higher profits even when the competition is tough.13
Customer satisfaction comes in large part from delivering unsurpassed value. The best measure of value is the size of the gap between product benefits and price. A product has value when its benefits to the customer are equal to or greater than the price that the customer pays. Keep in mind that the cheapest product doesn't necessarily represent the best value. If a 99-cent toy from Big Lots breaks in a day, customers may be willing to pay several dollars more for a similar toy from somewhere else. But if that 99-cent toy lasts all year, customers will be delighted by the value and will likely encourage their friends and family to shop at	customer satisfaction comes in large part from delivering unsurpassed value . the best measure of value is the size of the gap between product benefits and price . a product has value when its benefits to the customer are equal to or greater than the price that the customer pays . keep in mind that the cheapest product does n't necessarily represent the best value . if a 99 - cent toy from big lots breaks in a day , customers may be willing to pay several dollars more for a similar toy from somewhere else . but if that 99 - cent toy lasts all year , customers will be delighted by the value and will likely encourage their friends and family to shop at

Leading Edge versus Bleeding Edge Speed-tomarket—the rate at which a firm transforms concepts into actual products—can be another key source of competitive advantage. And the pace of change just keeps getting faster. In this tumultuous setting, companies that stay ahead of the pack often enjoy a distinct advantage. But keep in mind that there's a difference between leading edge and bleeding edge. Bleeding-edge firms launch products that fail because they're too far ahead of the market. During the late 1990s, for example, in the heart of the dot.com boom, Webvan, a grocery delivery service, launched to huge fanfare. But the firm went bankrupt just a few years later in 2001, partly because customers weren't yet ready to dump traditional grocery stores in favor of cyber-shopping.	leading edge versus bleeding edge speed - tomarket — the rate at which a firm transforms concepts into actual products — can be another key source of competitive advantage . and the pace of change just keeps getting faster . in this tumultuous setting , companies that stay ahead of the pack often enjoy a distinct advantage . but keep in mind that there 's a difference between leading edge and bleeding edge . bleeding - edge firms launch products that fail because they 're too far ahead of the market . during the late 1990s , for example , in the heart of the dot.com boom , webvan , a grocery delivery service , launched to huge fanfare . but the firm went bankrupt just a few years later in 2001 , partly because customers were n't yet ready to dump traditional grocery stores in favor of cyber - shopping .

Recognizing the potential of the Hispanic market, Japanese automakers have begun actively targeting Latino customers. Because of these efforts, Hispanic customers are reportedly 15% more likely than any other group to buy a Japanese-made car.

Growing diversity also affects the workforce. A diverse staff—one that reflects an increasingly diverse marketplace—can yield a powerful competitive advantage in terms of both innovation and ability to reach a broad customer base. From global behemoths, such as Coca-Cola and Verizon, to local corner stores, companies have taken proactive steps to hire and nurture people from a broad range of backgrounds. And that doesn't just reflect racial or ethnic roots. True diversity also includes differences in gender, age, religion, and nationality, among other areas. Leading-edge firms have also taken proactive steps to train their entire workforce to manage diversity for top performance.25	growing diversity also affects the workforce . a diverse staff — one that reflects an increasingly diverse marketplace — can yield a powerful competitive advantage in terms of both innovation and ability to reach a broad customer base . from global behemoths , such as coca - cola and verizon , to local corner stores , companies have taken proactive steps to hire and nurture people from a broad range of backgrounds . and that does n't just reflect racial or ethnic roots . true diversity also includes differences in gender , age , religion , and nationality , among other areas . leading - edge firms have also taken proactive steps to train their entire workforce to manage diversity for top performance.25
Effectively managing diversity should only become easier as time goes by. Multiple studies demonstrate that young American adults are the most tolerant age group, and they are moving in a more tolerant direction than earlier generations regarding racial differences, immigrants, and homosexuality. As this generation gathers influence and experience in the workforce, they are likely to leverage diversity in their organizations to hone their edge in a fiercely competitive marketplace.26	effectively managing diversity should only become easier as time goes by . multiple studies demonstrate that young american adults are the most tolerant age group , and they are moving in a more tolerant direction than earlier generations regarding racial differences , immigrants , and homosexuality . as this generation gathers influence and experience in the workforce , they are likely to leverage diversity in their organizations to hone their edge in a fiercely competitive marketplace.26
number of people in China over the age of 60 will double, leading to a nation where the retired will outnumber the entire population of Western Europe. There are currently six workers to every retiree, but China's one-child policy suggests that the number of people providing for the old will rapidly collapse.27	number of people in china over the age of 60 will double , leading to a nation where the retired will outnumber the entire population of western europe . there are currently six workers to every retiree , but china 's one - child policy suggests that the number of people providing for the old will rapidly collapse.27
The rapidly aging population brings opportunities and threats for business. Companies in fields that cater to the elderly—such as healthcare, pharmaceuticals, travel, recreation, and financial management—will clearly boom. But creative companies in other fields will capitalize on the trend as well by reimagining their current products to serve older clients. Possibilities include books and movies—maybe even video games—with mature characters; low-impact fitness programs such as water aerobics; and cell phones and PDAs with more readable screens. Again, the potential payoff of age diversity is clear: companies with older employees are more likely to find innovative ways to reach the aging consumer market.	the rapidly aging population brings opportunities and threats for business . companies in fields that cater to the elderly — such as healthcare , pharmaceuticals , travel , recreation , and financial management — will clearly boom . but creative companies in other fields will capitalize on the trend as well by reimagining their current products to serve older clients . possibilities include books and movies — maybe even video games — with mature characters ; low - impact fitness programs such as water aerobics ; and cell phones and pdas with more readable screens . again , the potential payoff of age diversity is clear : companies with older employees are more likely to find innovative ways to reach the aging consumer market .
But the larger numbers of retired people also pose significant threats to overall business success. With a smaller labor pool, companies will need to compete even harder for top talent, driving up recruitment and payroll costs.	but the larger numbers of retired people also pose significant threats to overall business success . with a smaller labor pool , companies will need to compete even harder for top talent , driving up recruitment and payroll costs .

Responsi­bility With high-profile ethical meltdowns dominating the headlines in the past few years, workers, consumers, and government alike have begun to hold businesses—and the people who run them—to a higher standard. Federal legislation, passed in the wake of the Enron fiasco, demands transparent financial management and more accountability from senior executives. And recognizing their key role in business success, a growing number of consumers and workers have begun to insist that companies play a proactive role in making their communities—and often the world community—better places. Sustainability—doing business today without harming the ability of future generations to meet their needs—has become a core issue in the marketplace, driving business policies, investment decisions, and consumer purchases on an unprecedented scale.29	responsi­bility with high - profile ethical meltdowns dominating the headlines in the past few years , workers , consumers , and government alike have begun to hold businesses — and the people who run them — to a higher standard . federal legislation , passed in the wake of the enron fiasco , demands transparent financial management and more accountability from senior executives . and recognizing their key role in business success , a growing number of consumers and workers have begun to insist that companies play a proactive role in making their communities — and often the world community — better places . sustainability — doing business today without harming the ability of future generations to meet their needs — has become a core issue in the marketplace , driving business policies , investment decisions , and consumer purchases on an unprecedented scale.29

A Multi-Pronged Threat In the past decade alone, war, terrorism, disease, and natural disasters have taken a horrific toll in human lives across the globe. The economic toll has been devastating as well, affecting businesses around the world. The 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York and Washington, D.C., decimated the travel industry and led to multibillion-dollar government outlays for Homeland Security. In 2002, a terrorist bombing at an Indonesian nightclub killed nearly 200 people, destroying tourism on the holiday island of Bali. Similarly, the 2015 terror attacks in Paris dealt a devastating blow to tourism throughout Europe, which was already struggling to handle an overwhelming refugee crisis.

In late 2011, the economy began to turn around at a very slow pace. Employment grew slowly for 49 months in a row—the best run since at least World War II. Although employment numbers improved, many people traded good-paying jobs for part-time work and/or lower-paying positions. This has constrained incomes and restrained consumer spending in the years since.7	in late 2011 , the economy began to turn around at a very slow pace . employment grew slowly for 49 months in a row — the best run since at least world war ii . although employment numbers improved , many people traded good - paying jobs for part - time work and/or lower - paying positions . this has constrained incomes and restrained consumer spending in the years since.7

Fiscal policy refers to government efforts to influence the economy through taxation and spending decisions that are designed to encourage growth, boost employment, and curb inflation. Clearly, fiscal strategies are closely tied to political philosophy. But regardless of politics, most economists agree that lower taxes can boost the economy by leaving more money in people's pockets for them to spend or invest. Most also agree that government spending can boost the economy in the short term by providing jobs, such as mail carrier, bridge repairer, or park ranger; and in the long term by investing in critical public assets, such as a national renewable energy grid. Done well, both taxation and spending can offer economic benefits. The tricky part is finding the right balance between the two approaches. As American economist Henry Hazlitt pointed out, it's important to keep in mind that “[e]ither immediately or ultimately, every dollar of government spending must be raised through a dollar of taxation; once we look at the matter in this way, the supposed miracles of government spending will appear in another light.”	fiscal policy refers to government efforts to influence the economy through taxation and spending decisions that are designed to encourage growth , boost employment , and curb inflation . clearly , fiscal strategies are closely tied to political philosophy . but regardless of politics , most economists agree that lower taxes can boost the economy by leaving more money in people 's pockets for them to spend or invest . most also agree that government spending can boost the economy in the short term by providing jobs , such as mail carrier , bridge repairer , or park ranger ; and in the long term by investing in critical public assets , such as a national renewable energy grid . done well , both taxation and spending can offer economic benefits . the tricky part is finding the right balance between the two approaches . as american economist henry hazlitt pointed out , it 's important to keep in mind that “ [ e]ither immediately or ultimately , every dollar of government spending must be raised through a dollar of taxation ; once we look at the matter in this way , the supposed miracles of government spending will appear in another light . ”

1962, and ten times since 2001, all with little or no notice. But as federal debt began to nudge the ceiling in 2011, it garnered unprecedented political and journalistic attention because various political groups saw the issue as an opportunity to further their political agenda. Those who wanted to raise the debt ceiling portrayed others as irresponsible buffoons who were willing to shut down the government simply to make a point without any real long-term change in spending. Those who did not want to raise the debt ceiling argued that the others are spendthrift bureaucrats who must learn to live within their means like the Americans who elected them.	1962 , and ten times since 2001 , all with little or no notice . but as federal debt began to nudge the ceiling in 2011 , it garnered unprecedented political and journalistic attention because various political groups saw the issue as an opportunity to further their political agenda . those who wanted to raise the debt ceiling portrayed others as irresponsible buffoons who were willing to shut down the government simply to make a point without any real long - term change in spending . those who did not want to raise the debt ceiling argued that the others are spendthrift bureaucrats who must learn to live within their means like the americans who elected them .
After weeks of high-profile wrangling, Congress finally agreed to raise the debt ceiling, which temporarily averted a shutdown crisis, but the deal they reached to do so created the fiscal cliff. The fiscal cliff was a package of draconian across-the-board spending cuts and sharp tax hikes scheduled to hit at the same time that could dramatically decrease the U.S. budget deficit. Going over the fiscal cliff could potentially cripple the U.S. economy, and possibly even cause the United States to default on some of its debt, which could send world markets into a tailspin.	after weeks of high - profile wrangling , congress finally agreed to raise the debt ceiling , which temporarily averted a shutdown crisis , but the deal they reached to do so created the fiscal cliff . the fiscal cliff was a package of draconian across - the - board spending cuts and sharp tax hikes scheduled to hit at the same time that could dramatically decrease the u.s. budget deficit . going over the fiscal cliff could potentially cripple the u.s. economy , and possibly even cause the united states to default on some of its debt , which could send world markets into a tailspin .
But once again, Congress could not reach a reasonable long-term agreement, so they simply passed last-minute legislation that pushed the really tough tax and spending decisions farther down the road. The federal government actually did shut down for 16 days in October 2013 after much congressional squabbling failed to produce a budget agreement. The government reopened with passage of another temporary agreement that again delayed the tough fiscal choices. If the country continues to fracture along political lines, it may become increasingly difficult to reach a federal budget agreement, leading to more regular government shutdowns.8	but once again , congress could not reach a reasonable long - term agreement , so they simply passed last - minute legislation that pushed the really tough tax and spending decisions farther down the road . the federal government actually did shut down for 16 days in october 2013 after much congressional squabbling failed to produce a budget agreement . the government reopened with passage of another temporary agreement that again delayed the tough fiscal choices . if the country continues to fracture along political lines , it may become increasingly difficult to reach a federal budget agreement , leading to more regular government shutdowns.8

The Fed is headed by a seven-member Board of Governors. The president appoints each member of the Board to serve a single 14-year term—though a member can also complete a former member's unexpired term and still be appointed to a full term of his or her own. These terms are staggered, with one expiring every two years, so that no single president can appoint all of the members.

How do open market operations work? When the economy is weak, the Fed buys government securities on the open market. When the Fed pays the sellers of these securities, money previously held by the Fed is put into circulation. This directly stimulates spending. In addition, any of the additional funds supplied by the Fed that are deposited in banks will allow banks to make more loans, making credit more readily available. This encourages even more spending and further stimulates the economy.	how do open market operations work ? when the economy is weak , the fed buys government securities on the open market . when the fed pays the sellers of these securities , money previously held by the fed is put into circulation . this directly stimulates spending . in addition , any of the additional funds supplied by the fed that are deposited in banks will allow banks to make more loans , making credit more readily available . this encourages even more spending and further stimulates the economy .

Buyers of the securities write checks to the Fed to pay for securities they bought, and the Fed withdraws these funds from banks. With fewer funds, banks must cut back on the loans they make, credit becomes tighter, and the money supply shrinks. This reduces spending and cools off the inflationary pressures in the economy.	buyers of the securities write checks to the fed to pay for securities they bought , and the fed withdraws these funds from banks . with fewer funds , banks must cut back on the loans they make , credit becomes tighter , and the money supply shrinks . this reduces spending and cools off the inflationary pressures in the economy .

discount rate, banks can obtain funds at a lower cost and use these funds to make more loans to their own customers. With the cost of acquiring funds from the Fed lower, interest rates on bank loans also tend to fall. The result: businesses and individuals are more likely to borrow money and spend it, which stimulates the economy. Clearly, the Fed is most likely to reduce the discount rate during recessions.	discount rate , banks can obtain funds at a lower cost and use these funds to make more loans to their own customers . with the cost of acquiring funds from the fed lower , interest rates on bank loans also tend to fall . the result : businesses and individuals are more likely to borrow money and spend it , which stimulates the economy . clearly , the fed is most likely to reduce the discount rate during recessions .

Reserve Requirement Changes The Fed requires that all of its member banks hold funds, called “reserves,” equal to a stated percentage of the deposits held by their customers. This percentage is called the reserve requirement (or required reserve ratio). The reserve requirement helps protect depositors who may want to withdraw their money without notice. Currently, the reserve requirement stands at about 10%, depending on the size and type of a bank's deposits. If the Fed increases the reserve requirement, banks must hold more funds, meaning they will have fewer funds available to make loans.	reserve requirement changes the fed requires that all of its member banks hold funds , called “ reserves , ” equal to a stated percentage of the deposits held by their customers . this percentage is called the reserve requirement ( or required reserve ratio ) . the reserve requirement helps protect depositors who may want to withdraw their money without notice . currently , the reserve requirement stands at about 10 % , depending on the size and type of a bank 's deposits . if the fed increases the reserve requirement , banks must hold more funds , meaning they will have fewer funds available to make loans .
If the Fed decreases the reserve requirement, some of the funds that banks were required to hold become available for loans. This increases the availability of credit and causes interest rates to drop. Since changes in the reserve requirement can have a dramatic impact on both the economy and the financial health of individual banks, the Fed uses this tool quite infrequently.	if the fed decreases the reserve requirement , some of the funds that banks were required to hold become available for loans . this increases the availability of credit and causes interest rates to drop . since changes in the reserve requirement can have a dramatic impact on both the economy and the financial health of individual banks , the fed uses this tool quite infrequently .

Pure competition is a market structure with many competitors selling virtually identical products. Since customers can't (or won't) distinguish one product from another, no single producer has any control over the price. And new producers can easily enter and leave purely competitive markets. In today's U.S. economy, examples of pure competition have virtually disappeared. Agriculture probably comes closest—corn is basically corn, for example—but with the dramatic growth of huge corporate farms and the success of major agricultural cooperatives such as Sunkist and pure competition A	pure competition is a market structure with many competitors selling virtually identical products . since customers ca n't ( or wo n't ) distinguish one product from another , no single producer has any control over the price . and new producers can easily enter and leave purely competitive markets . in today 's u.s. economy , examples of pure competition have virtually disappeared . agriculture probably comes closest — corn is basically corn , for example — but with the dramatic growth of huge corporate farms and the success of major agricultural cooperatives such as sunkist and pure competition a

Monopoly is a market structure with just a single producer completely dominating the industry, leaving no room for any significant competitors. Monopolies usually aren't good for anyone but the company that has control, since without competition there isn't any incentive to hold down prices or increase quality and choices. Because monopolies can harm the economy, most are illegal according to federal legislation such as the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and the Clayton Antitrust Act of 1914. Microsoft is the latest example of an industry giant that ran afoul of antimonopoly laws due to its position and policies in the software business.	monopoly is a market structure with just a single producer completely dominating the industry , leaving no room for any significant competitors . monopolies usually are n't good for anyone but the company that has control , since without competition there is n't any incentive to hold down prices or increase quality and choices . because monopolies can harm the economy , most are illegal according to federal legislation such as the sherman antitrust act of 1890 and the clayton antitrust act of 1914 . microsoft is the latest example of an industry giant that ran afoul of antimonopoly laws due to its position and policies in the software business .

In a free market system, the continual interplay between buyers and sellers determines the selection of products and prices available in the economy. If a business makes something that few people actually want, sales will be low, and the firm will typically yank the product from the market.	in a free market system , the continual interplay between buyers and sellers determines the selection of products and prices available in the economy . if a business makes something that few people actually want , sales will be low , and the firm will typically yank the product from the market .
Similarly, if the price of a product is too high, low sales will dictate a price cut. But if a new good or service becomes a hit, you can bet that similar offerings from other firms will pop up almost immediately (unless barriers—such as government-granted patents—prevent new entrants). The concepts of supply and demand explain how the dynamic interaction between buyers and sellers directly affects the range of products and prices in the free market.	similarly , if the price of a product is too high , low sales will dictate a price cut . but if a new good or service becomes a hit , you can bet that similar offerings from other firms will pop up almost immediately ( unless barriers — such as government - granted patents — prevent new entrants ) . the concepts of supply and demand explain how the dynamic interaction between buyers and sellers directly affects the range of products and prices in the free market .

Since businesses seek to make as much profit as possible, they are likely to produce more of a product that commands a higher market price and less of a product that commands a lower price. Think about it in terms of pizza. Assume it costs a local restaurant about $5 to make a pizza. If the market price for pizza hits, say, $20, you can bet that restaurant will start cranking out pizza. But if the price drops to $6, the restaurant has much less incentive to focus on pizza and will probably invest its limited resources in cooking other more pricey dishes.	since businesses seek to make as much profit as possible , they are likely to produce more of a product that commands a higher market price and less of a product that commands a lower price . think about it in terms of pizza . assume it costs a local restaurant about $ 5 to make a pizza . if the market price for pizza hits , say , $ 20 , you can bet that restaurant will start cranking out pizza . but if the price drops to $ 6 , the restaurant has much less incentive to focus on pizza and will probably invest its limited resources in cooking other more pricey dishes .

different market prices. Since consumers generally seek to get the products they need (or want) at the lowest possible prices, they tend to buy more products with lower prices and fewer products with higher prices. Pizza and tacos, for instance, are both popular meals. But if pizza costs a lot less than tacos, most people will get pizza more often than tacos. Likewise, if the price of pizza were out of hand, people would probably order tacos (or some other option) more often, reserving their pizzaeating for special occasions.	different market prices . since consumers generally seek to get the products they need ( or want ) at the lowest possible prices , they tend to buy more products with lower prices and fewer products with higher prices . pizza and tacos , for instance , are both popular meals . but if pizza costs a lot less than tacos , most people will get pizza more often than tacos . likewise , if the price of pizza were out of hand , people would probably order tacos ( or some other option ) more often , reserving their pizzaeating for special occasions .
The relationship between price and quantity from a demand standpoint can be shown on a graph called the demand curve. Like the supply curve, the demand curve maps quantity on the x-axis and price on the y-axis. But different from the supply curve, the demand curve for most goods and services slopes downward as it moves to the right, since the quantity demanded tends to drop as prices rise.

Socialist economies also tend to have higher taxes, which are designed to distribute wealth more evenly through society. Tax revenues typically fund services that citizens in free enterprise systems would have to pay for themselves in countries with lower tax rates. Examples range from free childcare to free university education, to free public healthcare systems. Critics of the recent government intervention in the U.S. economy believe that the new moves have pushed us too far in a socialist direction.	socialist economies also tend to have higher taxes , which are designed to distribute wealth more evenly through society . tax revenues typically fund services that citizens in free enterprise systems would have to pay for themselves in countries with lower tax rates . examples range from free childcare to free university education , to free public healthcare systems . critics of the recent government intervention in the u.s. economy believe that the new moves have pushed us too far in a socialist direction .

For years upon years, parents and grandparents have counseled their children with this sage advice: “Waste not, want not.” Yet somewhat ironically, this age-old wisdom applies just as much to the on-demand economy, which puts idle resources to work for the benefit of society. This growing trend has radically changed consumer expectations in regards to sustainability. According to trendspotting experts, younger consumers increasingly expect the companies they buy from to create new sources of value and to eliminate wasted resources in creative ways.

Communism is an economic and political system that calls for public ownership of virtually all enterprises, under the direction of a strong central government. The communist concept was the brainchild of political philosopher Karl Marx, who outlined its core principles in his 1848 Communist Manifesto. The communism that Marx envisioned was supposed to dramatically improve the lot of the worker at the expense of the super-rich.	communism is an economic and political system that calls for public ownership of virtually all enterprises , under the direction of a strong central government . the communist concept was the brainchild of political philosopher karl marx , who outlined its core principles in his 1848 communist manifesto . the communism that marx envisioned was supposed to dramatically improve the lot of the worker at the expense of the super - rich .

have begun moving toward the market end of the spectrum. Government-owned businesses have converted to private ownership via a process called privatization. Socialist governments have reduced red tape, cracked down on corruption, and created new laws to protect economic rights. Extravagant human services—from free healthcare to education subsidies—have shrunk. And farreaching tax reform has created new incentives for both domestic and foreign investment in once-stagnant planned economies.15	have begun moving toward the market end of the spectrum . government - owned businesses have converted to private ownership via a process called privatization . socialist governments have reduced red tape , cracked down on corruption , and created new laws to protect economic rights . extravagant human services — from free healthcare to education subsidies — have shrunk . and farreaching tax reform has created new incentives for both domestic and foreign investment in once - stagnant planned economies.15

So you probably won't be surprised to learn that no single measure captures all the dimensions of economic performance. To get the full picture, you need to understand a range of terms and measures, including gross domestic product, employment level, the business cycle, inflation rate, and productivity.	so you probably wo n't be surprised to learn that no single measure captures all the dimensions of economic performance . to get the full picture , you need to understand a range of terms and measures , including gross domestic product , employment level , the business cycle , inflation rate , and productivity .
Real gross domestic product, or GDP, measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a nation's physical boundaries over a given period of time, adjusted for inflation. (Nominal GDP does not include an inflation adjustment.) All domestic production is included in the GDP, even when the producer is foreign-owned. The U.S. GDP, for instance, includes the value of Hyundai Sonatas built in Alabama, even though Hyundai is a Korean firm. Likewise, the Indonesian GDP includes the value of Gap clothing manufactured in Indonesian factories, even though Gap is an	real gross domestic product , or gdp , measures the total value of all final goods and services produced within a nation 's physical boundaries over a given period of time , adjusted for inflation .

The overall level of employment is another key element of economic health. When people have jobs, they have money, which allows them to spend and invest, fueling economic growth. Most nations track employment levels largely through the unemployment rate, which includes everyone age 16 and older who doesn't have a job and is actively seeking one. The U.S. unemployment rate climbed precipitously through the Great Recession, rising from 5.8% in 2008 to 9.3% in 2009, then dropping to	the overall level of employment is another key element of economic health . when people have jobs , they have money , which allows them to spend and invest , fueling economic growth . most nations track employment levels largely through the unemployment rate , which includes everyone age 16 and older who does n't have a job and is actively seeking one . the u.s. unemployment rate climbed precipitously through the great recession , rising from 5.8 % in 2008 to 9.3 % in 2009 , then dropping to

Interestingly, some unemployment is actually good—it reflects your freedom to change jobs. If you have an awful boss, for instance, you may just quit. If you quit, are you unemployed? Of course you are. Are you glad? You probably are, and in normal times, the chances are good that you'll find another position that's a better fit for you. This type of job loss is called frictional unemployment, and it tends to be ultimately positive.	interestingly , some unemployment is actually good — it reflects your freedom to change jobs . if you have an awful boss , for instance , you may just quit . if you quit , are you unemployed ? of course you are . are you glad ? you probably are , and in normal times , the chances are good that you 'll find another position that 's a better fit for you . this type of job loss is called frictional unemployment , and it tends to be ultimately positive .
Structural unemployment, on the other hand, is usually longer term. This category encompasses people who don't have jobs because the economy no longer needs their skills. In the United States, growing numbers of workers in the past decade have found themselves victims of structural unemployment as manufacturing jobs have moved overseas. Often their only option is expensive retraining. Two other categories of unemployment are cyclical, which involves layoffs during recessions, and seasonal, which involves job loss related to the time of year. In some areas of the country, construction and agricultural workers are seasonally unemployed, but the best example may be the department-store Santa who has a job only during the holiday season!	structural unemployment , on the other hand , is usually longer term . this category encompasses people who do n't have jobs because the economy no longer needs their skills . in the united states , growing numbers of workers in the past decade have found themselves victims of structural unemployment as manufacturing jobs have moved overseas . often their only option is expensive retraining . two other categories of unemployment are cyclical , which involves layoffs during recessions , and seasonal , which involves job loss related to the time of year . in some areas of the country , construction and agricultural workers are seasonally unemployed , but the best example may be the department - store santa who has a job only during the holiday season !

CPI measures the change in weighted-average price over time in a consumer “market basket” of goods and services that the average person buys each month.	cpi measures the change in weighted - average price over time in a consumer “ market basket ” of goods and services that the average person buys each month .
The U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics creates the basket— which includes hundreds of items such as housing, transportation, haircuts, wine, and pet care—using data from more than 30,000 consumers. Although the market basket is meant to represent the average consumer, keep in mind that the “average” includes a lot of variation, so the CPI may not reflect your personal experience. For example, as a college student, you may be painfully sensitive to increases in tuition and the price of textbooks—a fact the authors of this particular textbook fully realize! But tuition and textbook prices aren't a big part of the ­“average” consumer's budget, so increases in these prices have a relatively small impact on the CPI.	the u.s. bureau of labor statistics creates the basket — which includes hundreds of items such as housing , transportation , haircuts , wine , and pet care — using data from more than 30,000 consumers . although the market basket is meant to represent the average consumer , keep in mind that the “ average ” includes a lot of variation , so the cpi may not reflect your personal experience . for example , as a college student , you may be painfully sensitive to increases in tuition and the price of textbooks — a fact the authors of this particular textbook fully realize ! but tuition and textbook prices are n't a big part of the ­“average ” consumer 's budget , so increases in these prices have a relatively small impact on the cpi .

Productivity refers to the relationship between the goods and services that an economy produces and the resources needed to produce them. The amount of output—goods and services—divided by the amount of input (e.g., hours worked) equals productivity. The goal, of course, is to produce more goods and services, using fewer hours and other inputs. A high level of productivity typically correlates with healthy GDP growth, while low productivity tends to correlate with a more stagnant economy.	productivity refers to the relationship between the goods and services that an economy produces and the resources needed to produce them . the amount of output — goods and services — divided by the amount of input ( e.g. , hours worked ) equals productivity . the goal , of course , is to produce more goods and services , using fewer hours and other inputs . a high level of productivity typically correlates with healthy gdp growth , while low productivity tends to correlate with a more stagnant economy .
Over the past cou­ple of decades, the United States has experienced strong productivity growth, due largely to infusions of technology that help workers produce more output, more quickly. But keep in mind that productivity doesn't measure quality. That's why it's so important to examine multiple measures of economic health rather than relying on simply one or two dimensions.	over the past cou­ple of decades , the united states has experienced strong productivity growth , due largely to infusions of technology that help workers produce more output , more quickly . but keep in mind that productivity does n't measure quality . that 's why it 's so important to examine multiple measures of economic health rather than relying on simply one or two dimensions .

In early 2016, financial experts noticed that American-based global corporations, such as Alphabet (the parent corporation of Google), General Motors, and Apple, were hoarding enormous—even unprecedented—amounts of cash.

and they are hoarding cash to invest in it. All of the transformative innovations of the past century—cars, for instance, or the emergence of the Internet—have required enormous investments in infrastructure, machinery, and technology. In many cases, the most successful companies were the ones that could make these investments early on. It's impossible to know if the corporate cash hoards are foreshadowing transformative innovation, but if they are, it bodes well for all of us. Jet packs, anyone? Flying cars?

Multinational businesses boomed throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. Powerful globe-spanning companies created economies of scale, dictated consumer trends in everything from movies to lingerie design, and crossed borders at will to create record-breaking profits. Many multinational corporations are still thriving—especially technology and consumer product superstars. In the past five years, however, the overall profits of multinationals have dropped by 25%. When President Donald Trump roared into office in 2017, he sent a clear message to American multinationals that they should keep jobs and spending at home or face his intervention. This America-first message reflected efforts by other countries to localize their businesses, build their tax bases, and increase domestic consumer spending. The era of multinationals brought global economic efficiency, lower prices, and unprecedented consumer choice. As global firms begin to refocus on their home countries, we may see more domestic jobs, but potentially at the cost of less innovation, fewer choices, and higher prices. One way or another, the next several years will be a formative time for the overall business environment.4	multinational businesses boomed throughout the 1990s and early 2000s . powerful globe - spanning companies created economies of scale , dictated consumer trends in everything from movies to lingerie design , and crossed borders at will to create record - breaking profits . many multinational corporations are still thriving — especially technology and consumer product superstars . in the past five years , however , the overall profits of multinationals have dropped by 25 % . when president donald trump roared into office in 2017 , he sent a clear message to american multinationals that they should keep jobs and spending at home or face his intervention . this america - first message reflected efforts by other countries to localize their businesses , build their tax bases , and increase domestic consumer spending . the era of multinationals brought global economic efficiency , lower prices , and unprecedented consumer choice . as global firms begin to refocus on their home countries , we may see more domestic jobs , but potentially at the cost of less innovation , fewer choices , and higher prices . one way or another , the next several years will be a formative time for the overall business environment.4
For the last two decades, experts have looked to the BRIC countries—Brazil, Russia, India, and China—as the engines of future world economic growth. And with their large populations, rapid development, and robust middle-class growth rates, the BRIC countries doubtless deserved that attention. By early 2016, however, the BRIC countries appeared to hit a wall.

China's long-term growth engine seems to be sputtering, many economists believe that the country will eventually regain momentum and will remain a powerful player in the global economy. Brazil and Russia, on the other hand, have actually been experiencing negative economic growth. Some 16% of young Brazilians are unemployed, boding poorly for the country's future. India remains the lone bright spot among the BRIC countries. Still, despite its ongoing economic strength, India must address important issues such as infrastructure investment and regulatory reforms to maintain its robust growth.	china 's long - term growth engine seems to be sputtering , many economists believe that the country will eventually regain momentum and will remain a powerful player in the global economy . brazil and russia , on the other hand , have actually been experiencing negative economic growth . some 16 % of young brazilians are unemployed , boding poorly for the country 's future . india remains the lone bright spot among the bric countries . still , despite its ongoing economic strength , india must address important issues such as infrastructure investment and regulatory reforms to maintain its robust growth .

Balance of payments is a measure of the total flow of money into or out of a country. Clearly, the balance of trade plays a central role in determining the balance of payments. But the balance of payments also includes other financial flows such as foreign borrowing and lending, foreign aid payments and receipts, and foreign investments. A balance of payments surplus means that more money flows in than out, while a balance of balance of trade A basic payments deficit means measure of the difference in value that more money flows out between a nation's exports and than in.

examples of how the exchange rate can influence the economy, using the dollar and the euro. In 2012, for example, a number of currencies underwent value swings versus the U.S. dollar (e.g., the E.U. euro, the J­apanese yen, the Brazilian real, the Indian rupee, the Australian dollar, and the Venezuelan bolivar). One result was multibillion-dollar earnings hits against U.S. corporations with a strong international presence, including automotive giants Ford and General Motors. Many firms opt to present their earnings reports stripped of the effects of currency translations, but in today's global economy, that clearly offers a misleading picture of performance.9	examples of how the exchange rate can influence the economy , using the dollar and the euro . in 2012 , for example , a number of currencies underwent value swings versus the u.s. dollar ( e.g. , the e.u. euro , the j­apanese yen , the brazilian real , the indian rupee , the australian dollar , and the venezuelan bolivar ) . one result was multibillion - dollar earnings hits against u.s. corporations with a strong international presence , including automotive giants ford and general motors . many firms opt to present their earnings reports stripped of the effects of currency translations , but in today 's global economy , that clearly offers a misleading picture of performance.9

A complete evaluation of global trade must also consider exchanges that don't actually involve money. A surprisingly large chunk of international commerce—possibly as much as 25%—involves the barter of products for products rather than for currency. Companies typically engage in countertrade to meet the needs of customers who don't have access to hard currency or credit, usually in developing countries. Individual countertrade agreements range from simple barter to a complex web of exchanges that end up meeting the needs of multiple parties. Done poorly, countertrading can be a confusing nightmare for everyone involved. But done well, countertrading is a powerful tool for gaining customers and products that would not otherwise be available.10 Not surprisingly, barter opportunities tend to increase during economic downturns.	a complete evaluation of global trade must also consider exchanges that do n't actually involve money . a surprisingly large chunk of international commerce — possibly as much as 25%—involves the barter of products for products rather than for currency . companies typically engage in countertrade to meet the needs of customers who do n't have access to hard currency or credit , usually in developing countries . individual countertrade agreements range from simple barter to a complex web of exchanges that end up meeting the needs of multiple parties . done poorly , countertrading can be a confusing nightmare for everyone involved . but done well , countertrading is a powerful tool for gaining customers and products that would not otherwise be available.10 not surprisingly , barter opportunities tend to increase during economic downturns .

There is no one “right way” to seize the opportunity in global markets. In fact, the opportunity may not even make sense for every firm. While international trade can offer new profit streams and lower costs, it also introduces a higher level of risk and complexity to running a business.	there is no one “ right way ” to seize the opportunity in global markets . in fact , the opportunity may not even make sense for every firm . while international trade can offer new profit streams and lower costs , it also introduces a higher level of risk and complexity to running a business .
Firms ready to tap the opportunity have a number of options for how to move forward. One way is to seek foreign suppliers through outsourcing and importing. Another possibility is to seek foreign customers through exporting, licensing, franchising, and direct investment. These market development options fall in a spectrum from low cost–low control to high cost–high control, as shown in Exhibit 3.2. In other words, companies that choose to export products to a foreign country spend less to enter that market than companies that choose to build their own factories. But companies that build their own factories have a lot more control than exporters over how their business unfolds. Keep in mind that profit opportunity and risk—which vary along with cost and control—also play a critical role in how firms approach international markets.	firms ready to tap the opportunity have a number of options for how to move forward . one way is to seek foreign suppliers through outsourcing and importing . another possibility is to seek foreign customers through exporting , licensing , franchising , and direct investment . these market development options fall in a spectrum from low cost – low control to high cost – high control , as shown in exhibit 3.2 . in other words , companies that choose to export products to a foreign country spend less to enter that market than companies that choose to build their own factories . but companies that build their own factories have a lot more control than exporters over how their business unfolds . keep in mind that profit opportunity and risk — which vary along with cost and control — also play a critical role in how firms approach international markets .

But while foreign outsourcing lowers costs, it also involves significant risk. Quality control typically requires very detailed specifications to ensure that a company gets what it actually needs. Another key risk of foreign outsourcing involves social responsibility. A firm that contracts with foreign producers has an obligation to ensure that those factories adhere to ethical standards. Deciding what those standards should be is often quite tricky, given different cultures, expectations, and laws in different countries. And policing the factories on an ongoing basis can be even harder than determining the standards. But companies that don't get it right face the threat of significant consumer backlash in the United States and Europe.	but while foreign outsourcing lowers costs , it also involves significant risk . quality control typically requires very detailed specifications to ensure that a company gets what it actually needs . another key risk of foreign outsourcing involves social responsibility . a firm that contracts with foreign producers has an obligation to ensure that those factories adhere to ethical standards . deciding what those standards should be is often quite tricky , given different cultures , expectations , and laws in different countries . and policing the factories on an ongoing basis can be even harder than determining the standards . but companies that do n't get it right face the threat of significant consumer backlash in the united states and europe .
This has been a particular issue with products produced in China. In the recent past, for instance, product defects forced U.S. firms to recall a host of Chinese-produced toys, including Thomas the Tank Engine trains that were coated with toxic lead paint, ghoulish fake eyeballs that were filled with kerosene, and Polly Pocket dolls that posed a swallowing hazard. And in 2013, Greenpeace released a study that showed that the bulk of children's clothing produced in China—the world's largest exporter of textiles— contains hazardous levels of toxic chemicals.12	this has been a particular issue with products produced in china . in the recent past , for instance , product defects forced u.s. firms to recall a host of chinese - produced toys , including thomas the tank engine trains that were coated with toxic lead paint , ghoulish fake eyeballs that were filled with kerosene , and polly pocket dolls that posed a swallowing hazard . and in 2013 , greenpeace released a study that showed that the bulk of children 's clothing produced in china — the world 's largest exporter of textiles — contains hazardous levels of toxic chemicals.12

Exporting is the most basic level of international market development. It simply means producing products domestically and selling them abroad. Exporting represents an especially strong opportunity for small and mid-sized companies. In Tennessee, for instance, Heritage Glass, a small firm that has manufactured glass since the Civil War, plans to reopen a factory that was shuttered for two years, to capitalize on strong demand for patterned glass from the Philippines, Europe, and South America.14	exporting is the most basic level of international market development . it simply means producing products domestically and selling them abroad . exporting represents an especially strong opportunity for small and mid - sized companies . in tennessee , for instance , heritage glass , a small firm that has manufactured glass since the civil war , plans to reopen a factory that was shuttered for two years , to capitalize on strong demand for patterned glass from the philippines , europe , and south america.14

They grew up during the dawn of social media and the smartphone, and they witnessed the global financial meltdown of the late 2000s. As a group, they are wealthier and likely to live longer than any previous generation. They also tend to be brainier thanks to more advanced education and better nutrition practices. The elite among them, such as 29-year-old Dropbox co-founder Arash Ferdowsi, have changed the world.

a fee from the company that buys the rights, or the licensee. This approach allows firms to expand into foreign markets with little or no investment, and it also helps circumvent government restrictions on importing in closed markets. But maintaining control of licensees can be a significant challenge. Licensors also run the risk that unethical licensees may become their competitors, using information that they gained from the licensing agreement. Foreign licensing is especially common in the food and beverage industry. The most high-profile examples include Coke and Pepsi, which grant licenses to foreign bottlers all over the world.	a fee from the company that buys the rights , or the licensee . this approach allows firms to expand into foreign markets with little or no investment , and it also helps circumvent government restrictions on importing in closed markets . but maintaining control of licensees can be a significant challenge . licensors also run the risk that unethical licensees may become their competitors , using information that they gained from the licensing agreement . foreign licensing is especially common in the food and beverage industry . the most high - profile examples include coke and pepsi , which grant licenses to foreign bottlers all over the world .

­ arket, it's critical to understand and ­evaluate the local economic conditions. Key factors to consider include population, per capita income, economic growth rate, currency exchange rate, and stage of economic development. But keep in mind that low scores for any of these measures don't necessarily equal a lack of opportunity. In fact, some of today's biggest opportunities are in countries with low per capita income. For example, the Indian division of global giant Unilever gets 50% of its sales from rural India by selling products to individual consumers in tiny quantities, such as two-cent sachets of shampoo. The rural Indian market has been growing so dramatically that in 2010, the chair of Hindustan Unilever declared, “What we have done in the last 25 years we want to do it in the next two years,” scaling up the reach of its consumer products from about 250,000 rural retail outlets to about 750,000. In a recent TED Talk, the chair of Hindustan Unilever passionately argued that including value, purpose, and sustainability in top-level decision-making is not just savvy—it's the only way to run a twenty-firstcentury business responsibly. And Hewlett-Packard has recently joined forces with Unilever to give microdistributors in rural India the ability to check prices and place orders online from “what are now distinctively offline villages and regions.” Also capitalizing on the rapid growth and increased demand, Samsung has introduced Guru, a mobile phone that can be charged with solar power, to rural India.	­ arket , it 's critical to understand and ­evaluate the local economic conditions . key factors to consider include population , per capita income , economic growth rate , currency exchange rate , and stage of economic development . but keep in mind that low scores for any of these measures do n't necessarily equal a lack of opportunity . in fact , some of today 's biggest opportunities are in countries with low per capita income . for example , the indian division of global giant unilever gets 50 % of its sales from rural india by selling products to individual consumers in tiny quantities , such as two - cent sachets of shampoo . the rural indian market has been growing so dramatically that in 2010 , the chair of hindustan unilever declared , “ what we have done in the last 25 years we want to do it in the next two years , ” scaling up the reach of its consumer products from about 250,000 rural retail outlets to about 750,000 . in a recent ted talk , the chair of hindustan unilever passionately argued that including value , purpose , and sustainability in top - level decision - making is not just savvy — it 's the only way to run a twenty - firstcentury business responsibly . and hewlett - packard has recently joined forces with unilever to give microdistributors in rural india the ability to check prices and place orders online from “ what are now distinctively offline villages and regions . ” also capitalizing on the rapid growth and increased demand , samsung has introduced guru , a mobile phone that can be charged with solar power , to rural india .
Effectively serving less developed markets requires innovation and efficiency. Emerging consumers often need different product features, and they almost always need lower costs. C. K. Prahalad, an influential business scholar, believed that forward-thinking companies can make a profit in developing countries if they make advanced technology affordable. Many markets are simply so large that high-volume sales can make up for low profit margins.	effectively serving less developed markets requires innovation and efficiency . emerging consumers often need different product features , and they almost always need lower costs . c. k. prahalad , an influential business scholar , believed that forward - thinking companies can make a profit in developing countries if they make advanced technology affordable . many markets are simply so large that high - volume sales can make up for low profit margins .

The level of infrastructure can vary dramatically among countries. In Africa, for instance, only 28.7% of the population has Internet access, compared to 88% in North America. In Vietnam and Thailand, many consumers buy products directly from vendors in small boats, compared to firmly grounded stores in Europe.	the level of infrastructure can vary dramatically among countries . in africa , for instance , only 28.7 % of the population has internet access , compared to 88 % in north america . in vietnam and thailand , many consumers buy products directly from vendors in small boats , compared to firmly grounded stores in europe .

Political regimes obviously differ around the world, and their ­policies have a dramatic impact on business. The specific laws and regulations that governments create around business are often less obvious, yet they can still represent a significant barrier to international trade. To compete effectively—and to reduce risk—managers must carefully evaluate these factors and make plans to respond to them both now and as they change.	political regimes obviously differ around the world , and their ­policies have a dramatic impact on business . the specific laws and regulations that governments create around business are often less obvious , yet they can still represent a significant barrier to international trade . to compete effectively — and to reduce risk — managers must carefully evaluate these factors and make plans to respond to them both now and as they change .
Laws and Regulations International businesses must comply with international legal standards, the laws of their own countries, and the laws of their host countries. This can be a real challenge since many developing countries change business regulations with little notice and less publicity. The justice system can pose another key challenge, particularly with regard to legal enforcement of ownership and contract rights. Since 2003, the World Bank has published a “Doing Business” report that ranks the ease of doing business for small and medium-sized companies in 190 different countries.

Bribery, the payment of money for favorable treatment, and corruption, the solicitation of money for favorable treatment, are also major issues throughout the world. While bribery and corruption are technically illegal in virtually every major country, they are often accepted as a standard way of doing business. Regardless, U.S. corporations and American citizens are subject to prosecution by U.S. authorities for offering bribes in any nation.

Political Climate The political climate of any country deeply influences whether that nation is attractive to foreign business. Stability is crucial. A country subject to strife from civil war, riots, or other violence creates huge additional risk for foreign business. Yet, figuring out how to operate in an unstable environment, such as Russia, Bolivia, or the Middle East, can give early movers a real advantage. Grant Winterton, Coca-Cola's regional manager for Russia, commented to Time magazine that “the politics do concern us.” But having snagged 50% of the $1.9 billion carbonated-soft-drink market, he concludes that “the opportunity far outweighs the risk.” Poor enforcement of intellectual property rights across international borders is another tough issue for business.

Planet Earth does not produce more fresh water—it simply recycles what it has—which isn't nearly enough in light of the planet's exploding human population; in fact, according to the World Health Organization, more than 2.4 million people die every year from lack of access to clean water, which is not surprising, given that 1 in 10 people lack access to clean water. Amazingly, the problem only stands to worsen. By 2050, one in five developing countries will face water shortages, many of them severe. By 2030, China, the world's most populous country, may no longer be self-sufficient in terms of wheat and corn production. Clearly, the growing water shortage is a human crisis, but it also will be a business crisis. Obviously, food and beverage companies depend on water. But when it comes right down to it, every industry from pharmaceuticals to semiconductors, to mining, to clothing manufacturing depends on water at some point in its supply or usage chain. Investment in clean water can pay off—big time.

are taxes levied against imports. Governments tend to use protective tariffs either to shelter fledgling industries that couldn't compete without help, or to shelter industries that are crucial to the domestic economy. In 2009, Egypt imposed tariffs on sugar, and the United States levied new tariffs on Chinese goods—including mattress springs and electrodes—that it contended were being dumped on the market at below-cost prices. In late 2014, the United States took steps toward imposing steep tariffs on Chinese-made tires, which it claimed were unfairly subsidized by the government.26	are taxes levied against imports . governments tend to use protective tariffs either to shelter fledgling industries that could n't compete without help , or to shelter industries that are crucial to the domestic economy . in 2009 , egypt imposed tariffs on sugar , and the united states levied new tariffs on chinese goods — including mattress springs and electrodes — that it contended were being dumped on the market at below - cost prices . in late 2014 , the united states took steps toward imposing steep tariffs on chinese - made tires , which it claimed were unfairly subsidized by the government.26

Voluntary export restraints (VERs) are limitations on the amount of specific products that one nation will export to another nation. Although the government of the exporting country typically imposes VERs, they usually do so out of fear that the importing country would impose even more onerous restrictions. As a result, VERs often aren't as “voluntary” as the name suggests.

An embargo is a total ban on the international trade of a certain item, or a total halt in trade with a particular nation. The intention of most embargoes is to pressure the targeted country to change political policies or to protect national security. The U.S. embargo against trade with Cuba offers a high-profile example.	an embargo is a total ban on the international trade of a certain item , or a total halt in trade with a particular nation . the intention of most embargoes is to pressure the targeted country to change political policies or to protect national security . the u.s. embargo against trade with cuba offers a high - profile example .
Perhaps the most dramatic change in the world economy has been the global move toward free trade— the unrestricted movement of goods and services across international borders. Even though complete free trade is not a reality, the emergence of regional trading blocks, common markets, and international trade agreements has moved the world economy much closer to that goal.	perhaps the most dramatic change in the world economy has been the global move toward free trade — the unrestricted movement of goods and services across international borders . even though complete free trade is not a reality , the emergence of regional trading blocks , common markets , and international trade agreements has moved the world economy much closer to that goal .

Bank is an international cooperative of 188 member countries, working together to reduce poverty in the developing world. The World Bank influences the global economy by providing financial and technical advice to the governments of developing countries for projects in a range of areas, including infrastructure, communications, health, and education. The financial assistance usually comes in the form of low-interest loans. But to secure a loan, the borrowing nation must often agree to conditions that can involve rather arduous economic reform.	bank is an international cooperative of 188 member countries , working together to reduce poverty in the developing world . the world bank influences the global economy by providing financial and technical advice to the governments of developing countries for projects in a range of areas , including infrastructure , communications , health , and education . the financial assistance usually comes in the form of low - interest loans . but to secure a loan , the borrowing nation must often agree to conditions that can involve rather arduous economic reform .

In fact, both the broader agenda and the individual decisions of the WTO have become increasingly controversial over the past ten years. Advocates for less-developed nations are deeply concerned that free trade clears the path for major multinational corporations to push local businesses into economic failure. A local food stand, for instance, probably won't have the resources to compete with a global giant such as McDonald's. If the food stand closes, the community has gained inexpensive hamburgers, but the entrepreneur has lost his livelihood, and the community has lost the local flavor that contributes to its unique culture.	in fact , both the broader agenda and the individual decisions of the wto have become increasingly controversial over the past ten years . advocates for less - developed nations are deeply concerned that free trade clears the path for major multinational corporations to push local businesses into economic failure . a local food stand , for instance , probably wo n't have the resources to compete with a global giant such as mcdonald 's . if the food stand closes , the community has gained inexpensive hamburgers , but the entrepreneur has lost his livelihood , and the community has lost the local flavor that contributes to its unique culture .

Between 2014 and 2016, approximately 3 million refugees poured into the European Union (EU) from Syria and other war-torn conflict zones in the Middle East. The overwhelming majority of those refugees sought a safe haven for themselves and their families—an opportunity to work hard and build a better future. They also sought to capitalize on the generous European social system, which provides education, healthcare, and ideally a chance at a fresh start. But not every country offered these newcomers a warm welcome. With economic growth rates slowing across Europe, many expressed concern about the high cost of integrating refugees. Others predicted a cultural clash between the refugees and current residents. Still others worried that the refugees would take their jobs. Despite these concerns, chances are good that the refugee influx will prove to be less of a crisis and more of an opportunity for the European Union.	between 2014 and 2016 , approximately 3 million refugees poured into the european union ( eu ) from syria and other war - torn conflict zones in the middle east . the overwhelming majority of those refugees sought a safe haven for themselves and their families — an opportunity to work hard and build a better future . they also sought to capitalize on the generous european social system , which provides education , healthcare , and ideally a chance at a fresh start . but not every country offered these newcomers a warm welcome . with economic growth rates slowing across europe , many expressed concern about the high cost of integrating refugees . others predicted a cultural clash between the refugees and current residents . still others worried that the refugees would take their jobs . despite these concerns , chances are good that the refugee influx will prove to be less of a crisis and more of an opportunity for the european union .

This workforce boost may be especially meaningful given that the populations of many EU countries are aging rapidly. The refugee population is relatively young, so they stand to replace workers who may soon be retiring in record numbers. Still, the IMF study emphasizes that rapid labor market integration is critical.

British citizens, especially older and more rural populations in England, were concerned that the country's unemployment and social services would be swamped under the weight of new immigrant arrivals as mandated by the EU. Many Brits were also concerned that that the country's identity and direction would increasingly be determined by the EU and become fused into a continental identity. The ultimate impact of the British exit will be unclear for months, and likely years, to come. The next several years in particular will be critical to the shape, size, and structure of the European economy.

Ethics and social responsibility—often discussed in the same breath—are closely related, but they are definitely not the same. Ethics refers to sets of beliefs about right and wrong, good and bad; business ethics involve the application of these issues in the workplace. Clearly, ethics relate to individuals and their day-to-day decision making. Just as clearly, the decisions of each individual can affect the entire organization.	ethics and social responsibility — often discussed in the same breath — are closely related , but they are definitely not the same . ethics refers to sets of beliefs about right and wrong , good and bad ; business ethics involve the application of these issues in the workplace . clearly , ethics relate to individuals and their day - to - day decision making . just as clearly , the decisions of each individual can affect the entire organization .

A given country's legal system provides a solid starting point for examining ethical standards. The function of laws in the United States (and elsewhere) is to establish and enforce ethical norms that apply to everyone within our society. Laws provide basic standards of behavior. But truly ethical behavior goes beyond the basics. In other words, your actions can be completely legal, yet still unethical. But since the legal system is far from perfect, in rare instances your actions can be illegal, yet still ethical. Exhibit 4.1 shows some examples of how business conduct can fall within legal and ethical dimensions. Clearly, legal and ethical actions should be your goal. Legality should be the floor—not the ­ceiling—for how to behave in business and ­elsewhere.	a given country 's legal system provides a solid starting point for examining ethical standards . the function of laws in the united states ( and elsewhere ) is to establish and enforce ethical norms that apply to everyone within our society . laws provide basic standards of behavior . but truly ethical behavior goes beyond the basics . in other words , your actions can be completely legal , yet still unethical . but since the legal system is far from perfect , in rare instances your actions can be illegal , yet still ethical . exhibit 4.1 shows some examples of how business conduct can fall within legal and ethical dimensions . clearly , legal and ethical actions should be your goal . legality should be the floor — not the ­ceiling — for how to behave in business and ­elsewhere .

This kind of two-faced thinking is dangerous because it can help people rationalize bigger and bigger ethical deviations. But the problem can be fixed by identifying universal ethical standards that apply to everyone across a broad spectrum of situations. Some people argue that we could never find universal standards for a country as diverse as the United States. But the nonprofit, nonpartisan Character Counts organization has worked with a diverse group of educators, community leaders, and ethicists to identify six core values, listed in Exhibit 4.2, that transcend political, religious, class, and ethnic divisions. universal ethical standards	this kind of two - faced thinking is dangerous because it can help people rationalize bigger and bigger ethical deviations . but the problem can be fixed by identifying universal ethical standards that apply to everyone across a broad spectrum of situations . some people argue that we could never find universal standards for a country as diverse as the united states . but the nonprofit , nonpartisan character counts organization has worked with a diverse group of educators , community leaders , and ethicists to identify six core values , listed in exhibit 4.2 , that transcend political , religious , class , and ethnic divisions . universal ethical standards

Imagine that you did a great job on a recent project at your company. Your boss has been very vocal about acknowledging your work and the increased revenue that resulted from it. Privately, she said that you clearly earned a bonus of at least 10%, but due to company politics, she was unable to secure the bonus for you. She also implied that if you were to submit inflated expense reports for the next few months, she would look the other way, and you could pocket the extra cash as well-deserved compensation for your contributions.	imagine that you did a great job on a recent project at your company . your boss has been very vocal about acknowledging your work and the increased revenue that resulted from it . privately , she said that you clearly earned a bonus of at least 10 % , but due to company politics , she was unable to secure the bonus for you . she also implied that if you were to submit inflated expense reports for the next few months , she would look the other way , and you could pocket the extra cash as well - deserved compensation for your contributions .

start-up. Is this fair? Not so much. In 2015, driver groups in Massachusetts and California sued Uber to be reclassified as employees. The two parties eventually reached a settlement that gave drivers some concessions but left them as independent contractors. In 2016, however, a federal judge rejected the settlement, declaring that it was “not fair, adequate, and reasonable.” The two parties are currently preparing to go to a jury trial. The outcome of this trial will affect not only the Uber Corporation and its drivers but also the overall structure of the gig economy that so many of us have come to rely on in one way or another.1	start - up . is this fair ? not so much . in 2015 , driver groups in massachusetts and california sued uber to be reclassified as employees . the two parties eventually reached a settlement that gave drivers some concessions but left them as independent contractors . in 2016 , however , a federal judge rejected the settlement , declaring that it was “ not fair , adequate , and reasonable . ” the two parties are currently preparing to go to a jury trial . the outcome of this trial will affect not only the uber corporation and its drivers but also the overall structure of the gig economy that so many of us have come to rely on in one way or another.1

The approach seems simple, but in practice it really isn't. Workers—and managers, too—often face enormous pressure to do what's right for the company or right for their career, rather than simply what's right. And keep in mind that it's completely possible for two people to follow the framework and arrive at completely different decisions, each feeling confident that he or she has made the right choice.	the approach seems simple , but in practice it really is n't . workers — and managers , too — often face enormous pressure to do what 's right for the company or right for their career , rather than simply what 's right . and keep in mind that it 's completely possible for two people to follow the framework and arrive at completely different decisions , each feeling confident that he or she has made the right choice .
Although each person is clearly responsible for his or her own actions, the organization can influence those actions to a startling degree. Not surprisingly, that influence starts at the top, and actions matter far more than words.

Research from the Ethics Resource Center (ERC) suggests that organizational culture has more influence than any other variable on the ethical conduct of individual employees. According to the ERC, key elements of a strong culture include displays of ethics-related actions at all levels of an organization and accountability for actions. The impact of these elements can be dramatic. Consider, for example, the following research results:	research from the ethics resource center ( erc ) suggests that organizational culture has more influence than any other variable on the ethical conduct of individual employees . according to the erc , key elements of a strong culture include displays of ethics - related actions at all levels of an organization and accountability for actions . the impact of these elements can be dramatic . consider , for example , the following research results :

A strong organizational culture works in tandem with formal ethics programs to create and maintain ethical work environments. A written code of ethics is the cornerstone of any formal ethics program. The purpose of a written code is to give employees the information they need to make ethical decisions across a range of situations. Clearly, an ethics code becomes even more important for multinational companies, since it lays out unifying values and priorities for divisions that are rooted in different cultures. But a written code is worthless if it doesn't reflect living principles.	a strong organizational culture works in tandem with formal ethics programs to create and maintain ethical work environments . a written code of ethics is the cornerstone of any formal ethics program . the purpose of a written code is to give employees the information they need to make ethical decisions across a range of situations . clearly , an ethics code becomes even more important for multinational companies , since it lays out unifying values and priorities for divisions that are rooted in different cultures . but a written code is worthless if it does n't reflect living principles .

Social responsibility is the obligation of a business to contribute to society. Similar to ethics, the broad definition is clear, but specific implementation can be complex. Obviously, the number-one goal of any business is long-term profits; without profits, other contributions are impossible. But once a firm achieves a reasonable return, the balancing act begins: How can a company balance the need to contribute against the need to boost profits, especially when the two conflict? The answer depends on the business's values, mission, resources, and management philosophy, which lead in turn to its position on social responsibility. Business approaches fall across the spectrum, from no contribution to proactive contribution, as shown in Exhibit 4.4.	social responsibility is the obligation of a business to contribute to society . similar to ethics , the broad definition is clear , but specific implementation can be complex . obviously , the number - one goal of any business is long - term profits ; without profits , other contributions are impossible . but once a firm achieves a reasonable return , the balancing act begins : how can a company balance the need to contribute against the need to boost profits , especially when the two conflict ? the answer depends on the business 's values , mission , resources , and management philosophy , which lead in turn to its position on social responsibility . business approaches fall across the spectrum , from no contribution to proactive contribution , as shown in exhibit 4.4 .

Stakeholders are any groups that have a stake—or a personal interest—in the performance and actions of an organization. Different stakeholders have ­different needs, expectations, and levels of interest. The federal government, for instance, is a key stakeholder in pharmaceutical companies but a very minor stakeholder in local art studios. The community at large is a key stakeholder for a coffee shop chain but a minor stakeholder for a web design firm. Enlightened organizations identify key stakeholders for their ­business and consider stakeholder priorities in their decision making. The goal is to balance their needs and priorities as effectively as possible, with an eye toward building their business over the long term.

But socially responsible employers go far beyond the law. They create a workplace environment that respects the dignity and value of each employee. They ensure that hard work, commitment, and talent pay off. They move beyond minimal safety requirements to establish proactive protections, such as ergonomically correct chairs and computer screens that reduce eyestrain. And the best employers respond to the ongoing employee search for a balance between work and personal life. With an increasing number of workers facing challenges such as raising kids and caring for elderly parents, responsible companies are stepping in with programs such as on-site day care, companysponsored day camp, and referral services for elder care.	but socially responsible employers go far beyond the law . they create a workplace environment that respects the dignity and value of each employee . they ensure that hard work , commitment , and talent pay off . they move beyond minimal safety requirements to establish proactive protections , such as ergonomically correct chairs and computer screens that reduce eyestrain . and the best employers respond to the ongoing employee search for a balance between work and personal life . with an increasing number of workers facing challenges such as raising kids and caring for elderly parents , responsible companies are stepping in with programs such as on - site day care , companysponsored day camp , and referral services for elder care .

Subway Eating “fresh” may not sound so appetizing once you learn that Subway's chicken products could be made from less than 50% actual chicken. According to tests performed at Trent University in Canada, the remainder of a Subway chicken breast patty consists of soy and other filler ingredients. Subway denies the allegations. In 2014, however, Subway customers learned that a food-grade material also found in yoga mats was used to make the company's bread.

AIG After the U.S. government pulled AIG from the brink of bankruptcy in 2008 with a bailout that topped $182 billion, the AIG board of directors voted in early 2013 about whether to join a lawsuit against the government, which claimed that the interest rate on the initial loan was excessive and the rescue was unfair to shareholders. Faced with public wrath and ridicule, they ultimately opted out of the lawsuit, but not before they further damaged their reputation among the general public.	aig after the u.s. government pulled aig from the brink of bankruptcy in 2008 with a bailout that topped $ 182 billion , the aig board of directors voted in early 2013 about whether to join a lawsuit against the government , which claimed that the interest rate on the initial loan was excessive and the rescue was unfair to shareholders . faced with public wrath and ridicule , they ultimately opted out of the lawsuit , but not before they further damaged their reputation among the general public .

Delivering quality products is another key component of social responsibility to consumers. Planned obsolescence—deliberately designing products to fail in order to shorten the time between consumer repurchases—­ represents a clear violation of social responsibility. In the long term, the market itself weeds out offenders. After all, who would repurchase a product that meets a premature end? But in the short term, planned obsolescence thins consumer wallets and abuses consumer trust.	delivering quality products is another key component of social responsibility to consumers . planned obsolescence — deliberately designing products to fail in order to shorten the time between consumer repurchases—­ represents a clear violation of social responsibility . in the long term , the market itself weeds out offenders . after all , who would repurchase a product that meets a premature end ? but in the short term , planned obsolescence thins consumer wallets and abuses consumer trust .

Responsibility to the Community: Business and the Greater Good Beyond increasing everyone's standard of living, businesses can contribute to society in two main ways: philanthropy and responsibility. Corporate philanthropy includes all business donations to nonprofit groups, including both money and products. The Giving USA Foundation reported that total corporate donations increased 3.9% in 2015, another banner year for giving across all sources (perhaps due to the robust economy).17 Corporate philanthropy also includes donations of employee time; in other words, some companies pay their employees to spend time volunteering at nonprofits. Patagonia, for example, allows workers after one year of service to apply for twomonth internships with environmental not-for-profits, during which time they're still paid by Patagonia.18	responsibility to the community : business and the greater good beyond increasing everyone 's standard of living , businesses can contribute to society in two main ways : philanthropy and responsibility . corporate philanthropy includes all business donations to nonprofit groups , including both money and products . the giving usa foundation reported that total corporate donations increased 3.9 % in 2015 , another banner year for giving across all sources ( perhaps due to the robust economy).17 corporate philanthropy also includes donations of employee time ; in other words , some companies pay their employees to spend time volunteering at nonprofits . patagonia , for example , allows workers after one year of service to apply for twomonth internships with environmental not - for - profits , during which time they 're still paid by patagonia.18

Taking an even broader perspective, some firms have started to measure their carbon footprint, with an eye toward reducing it.

The ultimate goal is to become carbon neutral—either to emit zero harmful gases or to counteract the impact of emissions by removing a comparable amount from the atmosphere through projects such as planting trees.	taking an even broader perspective , some firms have started to measure their carbon footprint , with an eye toward reducing it . carbon footprint refers to the amount of harmful greenhouse gases that a firm emits throughout its operations , both directly and indirectly . the ultimate goal is to become carbon neutral — either to emit zero harmful gases or to counteract the impact of emissions by removing a comparable amount from the atmosphere through projects such as planting trees .

Globalization has made ethics and social responsibility even more complicated for workers at every level. Bribery and corruption are among the most challenging issues faced by companies and individuals that are involved in international business. Transparency International, a leading anticorruption organization, published its yearly index of “perceived corruption” across 168 countries in 2015.

Just over half had no female C-suite executives, and fewer than 5% had a female CEO—although there was considerable variation among countries and industries. The study also showed that these numbers matter to the bottom line. Going from having no women in corporate leadership to a 30% share of women is associated with a 1% increase in net margin, which translates to a 15% increase in profitability for a typical firm—wow!	could make a real difference to profitability . a new global study of nearly 22,000 firms found that in 2014 , almost 60 % of these firms had no female board members . just over half had no female c - suite executives , and fewer than 5 % had a female ceo — although there was considerable variation among countries and industries . the study also showed that these numbers matter to the bottom line . going from having no women in corporate leadership to a 30 % share of women is associated with a 1 % increase in net margin , which translates to a 15 % increase in profitability for a typical firm — wow !

As you read the definitions, keep in mind that with a bit of extra effort, most are surmountable, and we'll discuss strategies and tips as we move through the chapter.	why is effective communication so challenging ? the key issue is noise , which is any interference that causes the message you send to be different from the message your audience understands . some experts define noise in terms of communication barriers , which arise in a number of different forms . as you read the definitions , keep in mind that with a bit of extra effort , most are surmountable , and we 'll discuss strategies and tips as we move through the chapter .

Dag Hammarskjold, the unspoken dialogue between two people can never be put right by anything they say. To avoid making devastating gaffes when engaging in international business, consider researching other cultures where you hope to do business. And don't just read books and articles—seek out and interact with people who are part of the target culture.

Outside of politics, more and more businesses depend on world events, filtered through the news, to guide their decision making. Millions of dollars hang in the balance, so the credibility of the news is crucial. But since mock news programs and websites enjoy more popularity than ever, business decision makers must make sure that they are in on the joke instead of the butt of the joke, which can't be as easy as it sounds, given the number of times legitimate news outlets and high-profile individuals have mistaken stories on The Onion website, a blatantly farcical mock news site, as real news.

When disgraced cyclist Lance Armstrong confessed to doping in a 2013 interview with Oprah Winfrey, body language expert Tonya Reiman noticed that despite the confidence of his words, he betrayed anxiety nonverbally by not meeting Ms. Winfrey's eyes, biting his lip, and repeatedly touching his face.

According to the International Listening Association website, 85% of our learning is derived from listening, yet listeners are distracted, forgetful, and preoccupied 75% of the time. If listening is so crucial, why do most of us have such a hard time engaging completely? One reason may be that people listen at about 125 to 250 words per minute, but think at about 1,000 to 3,000 words per minute—that's a significant gap. Common ways to fill the void include daydreaming, thinking about the past (e.g., last night), and planning for the future (e.g., later in the day).5	according to the international listening association website , 85 % of our learning is derived from listening , yet listeners are distracted , forgetful , and preoccupied 75 % of the time . if listening is so crucial , why do most of us have such a hard time engaging completely ? one reason may be that people listen at about 125 to 250 words per minute , but think at about 1,000 to 3,000 words per minute — that 's a significant gap . common ways to fill the void include daydreaming , thinking about the past ( e.g. , last night ) , and planning for the future ( e.g. , later in the day).5

As with most communication, the needs of the audience are the best place to begin. How does your audience feel about you and your topic? Are they interested? Hostile? Positive?

For instance, an eager, educated audience might not need as much background as a more lethargic, less-interested audience.	as with most communication , the needs of the audience are the best place to begin . how does your audience feel about you and your topic ? are they interested ? hostile ? positive ? what were they doing before your presentation ? dragging themselves out of bed after a late night at a sales meeting ? eating lunch ? use this information to guide how you develop your presentation . for instance , an eager , educated audience might not need as much background as a more lethargic , less - interested audience .

The most common presentation mistake is to include too many key ideas in the body of your presentation. Audiences simply cannot absorb more than two to four main points, and three are ideal. Specific examples and vivid comparisons will illustrate your points and bring them to life, while trusted sources, specific data, and expert quotations will increase your credibility and persuasiveness. Regardless of the length of your presentation, be sure to use clear transitions as you move from point to point.	the most common presentation mistake is to include too many key ideas in the body of your presentation . audiences simply can not absorb more than two to four main points , and three are ideal . specific examples and vivid comparisons will illustrate your points and bring them to life , while trusted sources , specific data , and expert quotations will increase your credibility and persuasiveness . regardless of the length of your presentation , be sure to use clear transitions as you move from point to point .

At the start of your presentation, decide whether you want to handle questions throughout your talk or save them for the end. Tell your audience your preference upfront; most of the time they will respect it. But if you do receive unwanted questions in the middle of your presentation, don't ignore them. Simply remind the questioner that you'll leave plenty of time for questions at the end.	at the start of your presentation , decide whether you want to handle questions throughout your talk or save them for the end . tell your audience your preference upfront ; most of the time they will respect it . but if you do receive unwanted questions in the middle of your presentation , do n't ignore them . simply remind the questioner that you 'll leave plenty of time for questions at the end .

Some people are naturals, but for the rest of us, dynamic delivery is a learned skill. It begins and ends with preparation, but keep in mind that practice doesn't always make perfect—in fact, practice more often just makes permanent. So be sure that you practice with an eye toward improvement. If possible, you should set up a practice situation that's close to the real thing. If you'll be standing to present, stand while you practice, since standing makes many people feel more vulnerable. Consider practicing in front of a mirror to work on eye contact and gestures. Also, try recording your voice to work on a lively tone.	some people are naturals , but for the rest of us , dynamic delivery is a learned skill . it begins and ends with preparation , but keep in mind that practice does n't always make perfect — in fact , practice more often just makes permanent . so be sure that you practice with an eye toward improvement . if possible , you should set up a practice situation that 's close to the real thing . if you 'll be standing to present , stand while you practice , since standing makes many people feel more vulnerable . consider practicing in front of a mirror to work on eye contact and gestures . also , try recording your voice to work on a lively tone .

Effective communication saves time and money—boosting performance and morale—across every area of business. But one vital principle holds true regardless of the more specific nature of your communication: the best way to achieve your goals is to focus on your audience, not on yourself. If you understand the goals, expectations, and needs of your audience, you can tailor your communication to boost your chances (sometimes dramatically) of accomplishing your objectives.	effective communication saves time and money — boosting performance and morale — across every area of business . but one vital principle holds true regardless of the more specific nature of your communication : the best way to achieve your goals is to focus on your audience , not on yourself . if you understand the goals , expectations , and needs of your audience , you can tailor your communication to boost your chances ( sometimes dramatically ) of accomplishing your objectives .

(if any) the business must pay, and the types of regulations it must follow. Choice of ownership also determines the degree to which each owner is personally liable for the firm's debts and the sources of funds available to the firm to finance future expansion. Finally, choosing the right business form helps entrepreneurs battle the steep odds against survival. Eighty percent of new businesses close within five years, and even 37% of large, established, and highly successful Fortune 500 and S&P 500 firms can be expected to fail every five years.1	( if any ) the business must pay , and the types of regulations it must follow . choice of ownership also determines the degree to which each owner is personally liable for the firm 's debts and the sources of funds available to the firm to finance future expansion . finally , choosing the right business form helps entrepreneurs battle the steep odds against survival . eighty percent of new businesses close within five years , and even 37 % of large , established , and highly successful fortune 500 and s&p 500 firms can be expected to fail every five years.1

2. A partnership is a voluntary agreement under which two or more people act as co-owners of a business for profit. As we'll see later in the chapter, there are several types of partnerships.

4. A limited liability company (LLC) is a hybrid form of business ownership that is similar in some respects to a corporation while having other characteristics that are similar to a partnership. Like a corporation, a LLC is considered a legal entity separate from its owners. Also like a corporation—and as its name implies—an LLC offers its owners limited liability for the debts of their business. But it offers more flexibility than a corporation in terms of tax treatment; in fact, one of the most interesting characteristics of an LLC is that its owners can elect to have their business taxed either as a corporation or a partnership. Many states even allow individuals to form single-person LLCs that are taxed as if they were sole proprietorships.	4 . a limited liability company ( llc ) is a hybrid form of business ownership that is similar in some respects to a corporation while having other characteristics that are similar to a partnership . like a corporation , a llc is considered a legal entity separate from its owners . also like a corporation — and as its name implies — an llc offers its owners limited liability for the debts of their business . but it offers more flexibility than a corporation in terms of tax treatment ; in fact , one of the most interesting characteristics of an llc is that its owners can elect to have their business taxed either as a corporation or a partnership . many states even allow individuals to form single - person llcs that are taxed as if they were sole proprietorships .
Sole proprietorships, partnerships, and corporations have been around in some form since the beginning of our nation's history, but limited liability companies are a relatively new form of ownership in the United States.

You've probably noticed that Exhibits 6.1 and 6.2 don't include specific information about limited liability companies. That's because these exhibits are based on information taken from annual tax returns submitted to the IRS. The IRS doesn't track LLC information separately.

We'll see that each form of ownership has distinct advantages and disadvantages. As a company grows and matures, the form of ownership that's best suited to its needs may change. Fortunately, the form of ownership for a business isn't set in stone. For example, it is possible—and in fact quite common—for business owners to convert from a sole proprietorship to a corporation, or from a corporation to a LLC.	we 'll see that each form of ownership has distinct advantages and disadvantages . as a company grows and matures , the form of ownership that 's best suited to its needs may change . fortunately , the form of ownership for a business is n't set in stone . for example , it is possible — and in fact quite common — for business owners to convert from a sole proprietorship to a corporation , or from a corporation to a llc .

Limited Financial Resources: Raising money to finance growth can be tough for sole proprietors. With only one owner responsible for a sole proprietorship's debts, banks and other financial institutions are often reluctant to lend it money. Likewise, suppliers may be unwilling to provide supplies on credit. This leaves sole proprietors dependent on their own wealth plus the money that their firms generate.	limited financial resources : raising money to finance growth can be tough for sole proprietors . with only one owner responsible for a sole proprietorship 's debts , banks and other financial institutions are often reluctant to lend it money . likewise , suppliers may be unwilling to provide supplies on credit . this leaves sole proprietors dependent on their own wealth plus the money that their firms generate .

Lack of Permanence: Because sole proprietorships are just extensions of their owners, they lack permanence. If the owner dies, retires, or withdraws from the business for some other reason, the company legally ceases to exist.

There is no limit on the number of partners who can participate in a general partnership, but most partnerships consist of only a few partners—often just two.

It is legally possible to start a partnership on the basis of a verbal agreement, but doing so is often a recipe for disaster.

The requirements, however, vary among the states. Some states are known for their simple forms, inexpensive fees, low corporate tax rates, and “corporation-friendly” laws and court systems. In those states, forming a corporation is not much harder or more expensive than setting up a sole proprietorship and sometimes can be simpler than forming a partnership. Not surprisingly, many large companies choose to incorporate in states with such favorable environments— even if they intend to do the majority of their business in other states. Delaware, in particular, has been very successful at attracting corporations. You may not think of Delaware as the home of corporate power, but more than half of all publicly traded corporations—and 64% of the firms listed in the Fortune 500—are incorporated in Delaware.11	the requirements , however , vary among the states . some states are known for their simple forms , inexpensive fees , low corporate tax rates , and “ corporation - friendly ” laws and court systems . in those states , forming a corporation is not much harder or more expensive than setting up a sole proprietorship and sometimes can be simpler than forming a partnership . not surprisingly , many large companies choose to incorporate in states with such favorable environments — even if they intend to do the majority of their business in other states . delaware , in particular , has been very successful at attracting corporations . you may not think of delaware as the home of corporate power , but more than half of all publicly traded corporations — and 64 % of the firms listed in the fortune 500 — are incorporated in delaware.11

One key difference between the two types of stock involves voting rights; common stockholders normally have the right to vote in stockholders' meetings, while preferred stockholders do not.

Stock in large corporations is usually publicly traded, meaning that anyone with the money and inclination to do so can buy shares—and that anyone who owns shares is free to sell them. But many smaller corporations are owned by just a handful of stockholders who don't actively trade their stock. It's even possible for individuals to incorporate their business and be the sole shareholder in their corporation.12	stock in large corporations is usually publicly traded , meaning that anyone with the money and inclination to do so can buy shares — and that anyone who owns shares is free to sell them . but many smaller corporations are owned by just a handful of stockholders who do n't actively trade their stock . it 's even possible for individuals to incorporate their business and be the sole shareholder in their corporation.12

According to Zuckerberg, “By using an LLC instead of a traditional foundation, we receive no tax benefit from transferring our shares to the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative (CZI), but we gain flexibility to execute our mission more effectively.” Being an LLC means that the CZI can spend its funds as quickly (or slowly) as needed (no annual 5% payout), change how it spends funds over time, and not have to disclose who it works with or how it invests its endowment funds. The CZI can even make political contributions and invest in for-profit businesses, all in support of its mission of encouraging “personalized learning, curing disease, connecting people and building strong communities.”	according to zuckerberg , “ by using an llc instead of a traditional foundation , we receive no tax benefit from transferring our shares to the chan zuckerberg initiative ( czi ) , but we gain flexibility to execute our mission more effectively . ” being an llc means that the czi can spend its funds as quickly ( or slowly ) as needed ( no annual 5 % payout ) , change how it spends funds over time , and not have to disclose who it works with or how it invests its endowment funds . the czi can even make political contributions and invest in for - profit businesses , all in support of its mission of encouraging “ personalized learning , curing disease , connecting people and building strong communities . ”

One State: When a business that's incorporated in one state does business in other states, it's called a “­domestic corporation” in the state where it's incorporated, and a “foreign corporation” in the other states. A corporation must register (or “qualify”) as a foreign corporation in order to do business in any state other than the one in which it incorporated. This typically requires additional paperwork, fees, and taxes. But registration as a foreign corporation is only necessary if the company is involved in substantial business activities within the state.	one state : when a business that 's incorporated in one state does business in other states , it 's called a “ ­domestic corporation ” in the state where it 's incorporated , and a “ foreign corporation ” in the other states . a corporation must register ( or “ qualify ” ) as a foreign corporation in order to do business in any state other than the one in which it incorporated . this typically requires additional paperwork , fees , and taxes . but registration as a foreign corporation is only necessary if the company is involved in substantial business activities within the state .
Businesses that only engage in minor business activities typically are exempt from the registration requirement.

Secrecy: Corporations are more closely regulated and are required to file more government paperwork than other forms of business. Large, publicly traded corporations are required to send annual statements to all shareholders and to file detailed quarterly and annual reports with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The annual report filed with the SEC (called a Form 10-K) is often hundreds of pages long and includes a wealth of information about the company's operations and financial condition.

One common type of divestiture, called a “spin-off,” occurs when a company issues stock in one of its own divisions or operating units and sets it up as a separate company—complete with its own board of directors and corporate officers.

Companies use divestiture to transfer total or partial ownership of some of their operations to investors or to another company. When a part of a company no longer fits strategically, divesting allows the firm to streamline operations and refocus on its core business.	companies use divestiture to transfer total or partial ownership of some of their operations to investors or to another company . when a part of a company no longer fits strategically , divesting allows the firm to streamline operations and refocus on its core business .
A common divestiture, called a spin-off, occurs when a company sets up a division as a separate company—complete with its own board of directors, corporate officers, and stock. The parent company then distributes stock in the new company to its existing stockholders. After the spin-off, the stockholders own shares of two separate companies, which they can buy, sell, or hold like any other stock.	a common divestiture , called a spin - off , occurs when a company sets up a division as a separate company — complete with its own board of directors , corporate officers , and stock . the parent company then distributes stock in the new company to its existing stockholders . after the spin - off , the stockholders own shares of two separate companies , which they can buy , sell , or hold like any other stock .

As the newest form of business ownership, state laws concerning the legal status and formation of LLCs are still evolving. Several states have recently revised their statutes to make forming LLCs simpler and to make transfer of ownership easier. Other states have kept more restrictive requirements intact. This diversity of state requirements, and the continuing evolution of LLC statutes, makes it difficult to provide meaningful generalizations about this form of ownership.16	as the newest form of business ownership , state laws concerning the legal status and formation of llcs are still evolving . several states have recently revised their statutes to make forming llcs simpler and to make transfer of ownership easier . other states have kept more restrictive requirements intact . this diversity of state requirements , and the continuing evolution of llc statutes , makes it difficult to provide meaningful generalizations about this form of ownership.16
In many respects, forming an LLC is similar to forming a corporation. As with corporations, LLCs are created by filing a document (which goes by a variety of names, such as certificate of organization or articles of organization) and ­paying filing fees in the state where the business is organized. Organizers of most LLCs also draft an operating agreement, which is similar to the bylaws of a corporation.	in many respects , forming an llc is similar to forming a corporation . as with corporations , llcs are created by filing a document ( which goes by a variety of names , such as certificate of organization or articles of organization ) and ­paying filing fees in the state where the business is organized . organizers of most llcs also draft an operating agreement , which is similar to the bylaws of a corporation .

Because LLCs are neither corporations nor partnerships, their owners are called members rather than stockholders or partners. Members of LLCs often manage their own company under an arrangement similar to the relationship among general partners in a partnership. However, some LLCs hire professional managers who have responsibilities much like those of the CEO and other top officers of ­corporations.	because llcs are neither corporations nor partnerships , their owners are called members rather than stockholders or partners . members of llcs often manage their own company under an arrangement similar to the relationship among general partners in a partnership . however , some llcs hire professional managers who have responsibilities much like those of the ceo and other top officers of ­corporations .

This eliminates the double taxation of profits that is endemic to general corporations. However, there are some cases where it makes sense for LLCs to elect to be taxed as a corporation.

While millions dream of running their own businesses, cost and inexperience are two big reasons one-third to one-quarter of small businesses fail within two years. Inexperienced entrepreneurs often struggle to get customers to buy from them rather than from existing businesses, and small business owners typically need a great deal of start-up capital to pay for offices, facilities, transportation, insurance, and salaries (but probably not for themselves until the business establishes itself financially).

­franchises. In a distributorship, the franchisor makes a product and grants distributors a license to sell it. The most common example of this type of franchise is the arrangement between automakers and the dealerships that sell their cars. In a business format franchise, the franchisor grants the franchisee the right to both make and sell its good or service. Under this arrangement, the franchisor usually provides a wide range of services to the franchisee, such as help with site selection, training, and help in obtaining financing, but also requires the franchisee to follow very specific guidelines while operating the business.

Both the franchisee and the franchisor must believe they'll benefit from the franchise arrangement; otherwise, they wouldn't participate. The advantages of franchising for the franchisor are fairly obvious. It allows the franchisor to expand the business and bring in additional revenue (in the form of franchising fees and royalties) without investing its own capital. Also, franchisees—business owners who are motivated to earn a profit—may have a greater incentive than salaried managers to do whatever it takes to maximize the success of their outlets.	both the franchisee and the franchisor must believe they 'll benefit from the franchise arrangement ; otherwise , they would n't participate . the advantages of franchising for the franchisor are fairly obvious . it allows the franchisor to expand the business and bring in additional revenue ( in the form of franchising fees and royalties ) without investing its own capital . also , franchisees — business owners who are motivated to earn a profit — may have a greater incentive than salaried managers to do whatever it takes to maximize the success of their outlets .

Another notable trend has been the growth in the number of women franchisees. Reliable statistics on women in franchising are difficult to find, but the International Franchising Association (IFA) estimates that women now own about 45% of all franchises, and anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend toward more womenowned franchises is continuing. A number of women, such as Dzana Homan (founder of School of Rock music lesson franchises), and Eileen Huntington, co-founder of Huntington Learning Centers, also have become very successful franchisors.21 But, despite these highly visible success stories, the number of women franchisors hasn't grown nearly as fast as the number of women franchisees.22	another notable trend has been the growth in the number of women franchisees . reliable statistics on women in franchising are difficult to find , but the international franchising association ( ifa ) estimates that women now own about 45 % of all franchises , and anecdotal evidence suggests that the trend toward more womenowned franchises is continuing . a number of women , such as dzana homan ( founder of school of rock music lesson franchises ) , and eileen huntington , co - founder of huntington learning centers , also have become very successful franchisors.21 but , despite these highly visible success stories , the number of women franchisors has n't grown nearly as fast as the number of women franchisees.22

Franchising also has some drawbacks. From the franchisor's perspective, operating a business with perhaps thousands of semi-independent owner–operators can be complex and challenging. With such a large number of owners, it can be difficult to keep all of the franchisees satisfied, and disappointed franchisees sometimes go public with their complaints, damaging the reputation of the franchisor. In fact, it isn't unusual for disgruntled franchisees to sue their franchisors.	franchising also has some drawbacks . from the franchisor 's perspective , operating a business with perhaps thousands of semi - independent owner – operators can be complex and challenging . with such a large number of owners , it can be difficult to keep all of the franchisees satisfied , and disappointed franchisees sometimes go public with their complaints , damaging the reputation of the franchisor . in fact , it is n't unusual for disgruntled franchisees to sue their franchisors .

If you're trying to decide whether franchising is a good opportunity, know that the millions of business people who bought and run franchises did so because franchising offers reduced risk, training and support from the franchisor, the advantage of instant brand recognition (as opposed to building a new brand from scratch), and easier access to funding as bankers and other lenders have greater confidence that a franchise business will succeed. Akram Khan, a KFC franchisee in the United Kingdom (UK) says, “When the opportunity to buy a franchise came up, I jumped at it. I like the structure of franchising—I haven't got the confidence to open my own restaurant. This way, you have the autonomy of your own restaurant but you have access to expertise.”	if you 're trying to decide whether franchising is a good opportunity , know that the millions of business people who bought and run franchises did so because franchising offers reduced risk , training and support from the franchisor , the advantage of instant brand recognition ( as opposed to building a new brand from scratch ) , and easier access to funding as bankers and other lenders have greater confidence that a franchise business will succeed . akram khan , a kfc franchisee in the united kingdom ( uk ) says , “ when the opportunity to buy a franchise came up , i jumped at it . i like the structure of franchising — i have n't got the confidence to open my own restaurant . this way , you have the autonomy of your own restaurant but you have access to expertise . ”

For example, the FDD must provide contact information for at least 100 current franchisees. (If the franchisor has fewer than 100 current franchisees, it must list all of them.) This gives a potential franchisee the ability to contact other franchisees and ask them about their experiences with the franchisor. As an added bonus, the FTC requires the FDD to be written in “plain English” rather than in the complex legal jargon that often characterizes such documents.

Banks and other lenders are understandably hesitant to fund a business that doesn't have a track record. And when they do, they require a lot of paperwork and often a fairly long waiting period. Given these hurdles, only 20% of new business owners launch with commercial loans. Unfortunately, small business lending fell 78% in the five years following the Great Recession.16 And virtually no ­conventional lending source—private or government—will lend 100% of the startup dollars for a new business. Most require that the entrepreneur provide a minimum of 25% to 30% of total start-up costs from personal resources.17	banks and other lenders are understandably hesitant to fund a business that does n't have a track record . and when they do , they require a lot of paperwork and often a fairly long waiting period . given these hurdles , only 20 % of new business owners launch with commercial loans . unfortunately , small business lending fell 78 % in the five years following the great recession.16 and virtually no ­conventional lending source — private or government — will lend 100 % of the startup dollars for a new business . most require that the entrepreneur provide a minimum of 25 % to 30 % of total start - up costs from personal resources.17

Not if the hackers are growth hackers! Growth hacking means using metrics, creative strategies, and state-of-the-art technology to accelerate the growth of your brand, service, or product far beyond the norm. Growth hackers know their customers inside and out, including their pain points. Perhaps more importantly, they also know which products and services will alleviate that pain. Often, growth hackers create blogs and other types of content that invite potential consumers to participate in conversations about the brand. And when people do participate, the growth hackers assiduously collect and massage the data, using it to generate leads, which they then transform into powerful growth. Growth hackers also test, test, test. Which works better—Strategy A or Strategy B? And after optimizing that choice, they move on to the next crossroads, and growth keeps booming. It's no surprise then that growth hacking has become a strategy of choice for new economic giants such as	not if the hackers are growth hackers ! growth hacking means using metrics , creative strategies , and state - of - the - art technology to accelerate the growth of your brand , service , or product far beyond the norm . growth hackers know their customers inside and out , including their pain points . perhaps more importantly , they also know which products and services will alleviate that pain . often , growth hackers create blogs and other types of content that invite potential consumers to participate in conversations about the brand . and when people do participate , the growth hackers assiduously collect and massage the data , using it to generate leads , which they then transform into powerful growth . growth hackers also test , test , test . which works better — strategy a or strategy b ? and after optimizing that choice , they move on to the next crossroads , and growth keeps booming . it 's no surprise then that growth hacking has become a strategy of choice for new economic giants such as

Technology The Internet has played a powerful role in opening new opportunities for small businesses. Using a wealth of online tools, from eBay to eMachineshop, companies-of-one can create, sell, publish, and even manufacture goods and services more easily than ever before. The Internet has also created international opportunities, transforming small businesses into global marketers. The London-based Anything Left-Handed retail store, for instance, evolved into an award-winning global wholesaler of left-handed items within a year of launching its website. Founder Keith Milsom comments that “our website has allowed us to communicate with potential customers and market our business worldwide at very little cost, making international development possible.”24	technology the internet has played a powerful role in opening new opportunities for small businesses . using a wealth of online tools , from ebay to emachineshop , companies - of - one can create , sell , publish , and even manufacture goods and services more easily than ever before . the internet has also created international opportunities , transforming small businesses into global marketers . the london - based anything left - handed retail store , for instance , evolved into an award - winning global wholesaler of left - handed items within a year of launching its website . founder keith milsom comments that “ our website has allowed us to communicate with potential customers and market our business worldwide at very little cost , making international development possible . ”24

High Risk of Failure Starting a new business involves risk—a lot of risk—but the odds improve significantly if you make it past the first five years. Check out the ten-year survival rate in Exhibit 7.2. Notice that it declines much more slowly in Years 7–10. Not surprisingly, new research also shows that the five-year survival rate depends fairly heavily on the industry, ranging from 51.3% at the high end for manufacturing to 36.4% at the low end for construction, as illustrated in Exhibit 7.3. So clearly, it pays to choose your industry carefully when you launch a new business.	high risk of failure starting a new business involves risk — a lot of risk — but the odds improve significantly if you make it past the first five years . check out the ten - year survival rate in exhibit 7.2 . notice that it declines much more slowly in years 7–10 . not surprisingly , new research also shows that the five - year survival rate depends fairly heavily on the industry , ranging from 51.3 % at the high end for manufacturing to 36.4 % at the low end for construction , as illustrated in exhibit 7.3 . so clearly , it pays to choose your industry carefully when you launch a new business .

Ongoing profits don't usually begin for a while, which means that entrepreneurs must plan on some lean months—or even years—as the business develops momentum. That means a real need to manage money wisely and to resist the temptation to invest in fixed assets, such as fancy offices and advanced electronics, before sufficient regular income warrants it. It also requires the nerve to stay the course despite initial losses.26	ongoing profits do n't usually begin for a while , which means that entrepreneurs must plan on some lean months — or even years — as the business develops momentum . that means a real need to manage money wisely and to resist the temptation to invest in fixed assets , such as fancy offices and advanced electronics , before sufficient regular income warrants it . it also requires the nerve to stay the course despite initial losses.26

Creating New Jobs: Small businesses with employees start up at a rate of about 600,000 per year. Five years after they launch, about half of those businesses—and many of the jobs they create—remain viable. But while small businesses are quick to add new jobs, they're ­often the first to contract when times are tough; ­instability comes with the territory.32	creating new jobs : small businesses with employees start up at a rate of about 600,000 per year . five years after they launch , about half of those businesses — and many of the jobs they create — remain viable . but while small businesses are quick to add new jobs , they 're ­often the first to contract when times are tough ; ­instability comes with the territory.32
Small patenting firms produce about 16 times more patents per employee than their large-firm counterparts, and those patents are twice as likely to be found among the top 1% of highest-impact patents. Small firms tend to be effective innovators for a number of reasons. Perhaps most importantly, their very reason for being often ties to a brandnew idea. In the early years, they need innovation to simply survive. And they often display a refreshing lack of bureaucracy that allows new thinking to take hold.33	small patenting firms produce about 16 times more patents per employee than their large - firm counterparts , and those patents are twice as likely to be found among the top 1 % of highest - impact patents . small firms tend to be effective innovators for a number of reasons . perhaps most importantly , their very reason for being often ties to a brandnew idea . in the early years , they need innovation to simply survive . and they often display a refreshing lack of bureaucracy that allows new thinking to take hold.33

Cultural/Political Environment Extensive, complex regulations can hinder entrepreneurship by raising daunting barriers. And a lack of cultural support only compounds the problem. These factors certainly contribute to the relatively low entrepreneurship rates in much of the European Union and Japan. Entrepreneurs in more supportive nations such as the United States and New Zealand get a boost from limited regulation and strong governmental support. A thriving “cowboy culture” helps, too—standout individuals who break free of old ways attract attention and admiration in many of the countries with higher entrepreneurship rates.35	cultural / political environment extensive , complex regulations can hinder entrepreneurship by raising daunting barriers . and a lack of cultural support only compounds the problem . these factors certainly contribute to the relatively low entrepreneurship rates in much of the european union and japan . entrepreneurs in more supportive nations such as the united states and new zealand get a boost from limited regulation and strong governmental support . a thriving “ cowboy culture ” helps , too — standout individuals who break free of old ways attract attention and admiration in many of the countries with higher entrepreneurship rates.35
Opportunity Costs Entrepreneurship rates are significantly lower in countries that provide a high level of employment protection (it's hard to get fired) and strong unemployment insurance (financial support if you do get fired). With these benefits in place, the sense of urgency regarding entrepreneurship tends to fall, in part because fear of failure is much lower. The European Union provides a number of clear examples.	opportunity costs entrepreneurship rates are significantly lower in countries that provide a high level of employment protection ( it 's hard to get fired ) and strong unemployment insurance ( financial support if you do get fired ) . with these benefits in place , the sense of urgency regarding entrepreneurship tends to fall , in part because fear of failure is much lower . the european union provides a number of clear examples .
Per Capita Income In lower-income countries, such as China and Chile, a high percentage of entrepreneurs start their own businesses because they simply have no other options. This contributes heavily to the startlingly high overall level of entrepreneurship. The rate of such “necessity entrepreneurship” declines in higherincome countries, such as the United States and Japan, where entrepreneurs are more likely to strike out on their own in response to an opportunity that they spot in the marketplace.	per capita income in lower - income countries , such as china and chile , a high percentage of entrepreneurs start their own businesses because they simply have no other options . this contributes heavily to the startlingly high overall level of entrepreneurship . the rate of such “ necessity entrepreneurship ” declines in higherincome countries , such as the united states and japan , where entrepreneurs are more likely to strike out on their own in response to an opportunity that they spot in the marketplace .

One of the major responsibilities of financial accounting is the preparation of three basic financial statements: the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows. Taken together, these financial statements provide external stakeholders with a broad picture of an organization's financial condition and its recent financial performance. Large corporations with publicly traded stock must provide an annual report containing all three statements to all stockholders. They also must file quarterly and annual reports, including financial statements, with the SEC. Let's take a look at the information each statement provides.	one of the major responsibilities of financial accounting is the preparation of three basic financial statements : the balance sheet , income statement , and statement of cash flows . taken together , these financial statements provide external stakeholders with a broad picture of an organization 's financial condition and its recent financial performance . large corporations with publicly traded stock must provide an annual report containing all three statements to all stockholders . they also must file quarterly and annual reports , including financial statements , with the sec . let 's take a look at the information each statement provides .

The other major category of assets on McDonald's balance sheets is Property, plant, and equipment. It lists the value, in this case $34.443 billion, of the company's land, buildings, machinery, equipment, and other long-term assets. With the exception of land, these assets have a limited useful life, so accountants subtract accumulated depreciation, $13.185 ­billion, from the original value of these assets, to reflect the fact that these assets are being used up over time.	the other major category of assets on mcdonald 's balance sheets is property , plant , and equipment . it lists the value , in this case $ 34.443 billion , of the company 's land , buildings , machinery , equipment , and other long - term assets . with the exception of land , these assets have a limited useful life , so accountants subtract accumulated depreciation , $ 13.185 ­billion , from the original value of these assets , to reflect the fact that these assets are being used up over time .
Though not shown here, some companies list a third category of assets, called intangible assets. These are assets that have no physical existence—you can't see or touch them—but they still have value. Examples include patents, copyrights, trademarks, and even the goodwill a company develops with its stakeholders. McDonald's trademarks, such as Ronald McDonald and the golden arches, clearly have tremendous value to the company.	though not shown here , some companies list a third category of assets , called intangible assets . these are assets that have no physical existence — you ca n't see or touch them — but they still have value . examples include patents , copyrights , trademarks , and even the goodwill a company develops with its stakeholders . mcdonald 's trademarks , such as ronald mcdonald and the golden arches , clearly have tremendous value to the company .
Liabilities indicate what the firm owes to nonowners—in other words, the claims nonowners have against the firm's assets. Balance sheets usually organize liabilities into two broad categories: current liabilities and long-term liabilities. Current liabilities, totaling $2.448 billion for McDonald's, are debts that come due within a year of the date on the balance sheet.

Accountants use accrual-basis accounting when recognizing revenues. Under the accrual approach, revenues are recorded when they are earned, and payment is reasonably assured. It's important to realize that this is not always when the firm receives cash from its sales. For example, if a firm sells goods on credit, it reports revenue before it receives cash. (The revenue would show up initially as an increase in accounts receivable rather than as an increase in cash.)	accountants use accrual - basis accounting when recognizing revenues . under the accrual approach , revenues are recorded when they are earned , and payment is reasonably assured . it 's important to realize that this is not always when the firm receives cash from its sales . for example , if a firm sells goods on credit , it reports revenue before it receives cash .

Expenses indicate the cash a firm spends, or other assets it uses up, to carry out the business activities necessary to generate its revenue. Under accrual-basis accounting, expenses aren't necessarily recorded when cash is paid. Instead, expenses are matched to the revenue they help generate. The specific titles given to the costs and expenses listed on an income statement vary among firms—as do the details provided. But the general approach remains the same: costs are deducted from revenue in several stages to show how net income is determined. The first step in this process is to deduct costs of goods sold, $12.698 billion for	expenses indicate the cash a firm spends , or other assets it uses up , to carry out the business activities necessary to generate its revenue . under accrual - basis accounting , expenses are n't necessarily recorded when cash is paid . instead , expenses are matched to the revenue they help generate . the specific titles given to the costs and expenses listed on an income statement vary among firms — as do the details provided . but the general approach remains the same : costs are deducted from revenue in several stages to show how net income is determined . the first step in this process is to deduct costs of goods sold , $ 12.698 billion for

difference between the firm's revenue and its cost of goods sold is its gross profit, which was $11.923 billion for McDonald's. The next step is to deduct operating expenses, totaling $4.178 billion for McDonald's, from gross profit. Operating expenses are costs the firm incurs in the regular operation of its business. Most income statements divide operating expenses into selling expenses (such as salaries and commissions to salespeople and advertising expenses) and general (or administrative) expenses (such as rent, insurance, utilities, and office supplies). McDonald's, however, typically owns the land and the building of franchised restaurants. So, it has another large, but specialized operating expense of $1.718 billion to pay for franchised restaurants' occupancy expenses. The difference between gross profit and operating expenses is net operating income, which is $7.744 billion for	difference between the firm 's revenue and its cost of goods sold is its gross profit , which was $ 11.923 billion for mcdonald 's . the next step is to deduct operating expenses , totaling $ 4.178 billion for mcdonald 's , from gross profit . operating expenses are costs the firm incurs in the regular operation of its business . most income statements divide operating expenses into selling expenses ( such as salaries and commissions to salespeople and advertising expenses ) and general ( or administrative ) expenses ( such as rent , insurance , utilities , and office supplies ) . mcdonald 's , however , typically owns the land and the building of franchised restaurants . so , it has another large , but specialized operating expense of $ 1.718 billion to pay for franchised restaurants ' occupancy expenses . the difference between gross profit and operating expenses is net operating income , which is $ 7.744 billion for

Firms that have more complex changes in the owners' equity section sometimes report these changes in notes to the financial statements in the annual report. But they often disclose these changes by providing a stockholders' equity statement.

example, auditors interview the company's accounting and bookkeeping staff to verify that they understand and properly implement procedures that are consistent with GAAP. They also examine a sample of specific source documents (such as sales receipts or invoices) and verify that the transactions they represent were properly posted to the correct accounts. Auditors also look for signs of fraud or falsified records. They often conduct an actual physical count of goods or supplies in inventory to determine the accuracy of the figures reported in the company's inventory records and contact the company's banker to verify its account balances. The audit process is rigorous, but it's important to realize that in large, public companies, it would be impossible for auditors to check the accuracy of every transaction.	example , auditors interview the company 's accounting and bookkeeping staff to verify that they understand and properly implement procedures that are consistent with gaap . they also examine a sample of specific source documents ( such as sales receipts or invoices ) and verify that the transactions they represent were properly posted to the correct accounts . auditors also look for signs of fraud or falsified records . they often conduct an actual physical count of goods or supplies in inventory to determine the accuracy of the figures reported in the company 's inventory records and contact the company 's banker to verify its account balances . the audit process is rigorous , but it 's important to realize that in large , public companies , it would be impossible for auditors to check the accuracy of every transaction .

An adverse opinion indicates that the auditor believes the financial statements are seriously flawed and that they may be misleading and unreliable.

The SEC requires publicly traded corporations to provide comparative financial statements. This simply means that the balance sheet, income statement, and statement of cash flows must list two or more years of figures side by side, making it possible to see how account values have changed over a period of time. Many firms that aren't publicly traded also present comparative statements, even though they are not required to do so by GAAP.	the sec requires publicly traded corporations to provide comparative financial statements . this simply means that the balance sheet , income statement , and statement of cash flows must list two or more years of figures side by side , making it possible to see how account values have changed over a period of time . many firms that are n't publicly traded also present comparative statements , even though they are not required to do so by gaap .

Another important source of information is the section of the annual report usually titled “Management's Discussion and Analysis.” As its name implies, this is where the top management team provides its take on the financial condition of the company. SEC guidelines require top management to disclose any trends, events, or risks likely to have a significant impact on the firm's financial condition in this section of the report. For 2016, the most significant item was achieving its three-year target of returning $30 billion in cash to shareholders (via dividends and stock buy backs).	another important source of information is the section of the annual report usually titled “ management 's discussion and analysis . ” as its name implies , this is where the top management team provides its take on the financial condition of the company . sec guidelines require top management to disclose any trends , events , or risks likely to have a significant impact on the firm 's financial condition in this section of the report . for 2016 , the most significant item was achieving its three - year target of returning $ 30 billion in cash to shareholders ( via dividends and stock buy backs ) .

(or participatory) budgeting. Organizations that use a participatory process allow middle and supervisory managers to participate actively in the creation of the budget. Proponents of this approach maintain that it has two major advantages. First, middle and supervisory managers are likely to know more about the issues and challenges facing their departments—and the resources it will take to address them—than top management. Second, middle and first-line managers are likely to be more highly motivated to achieve budgetary goals when they have a say in how those goals are developed.

The budgeting process actually requires the preparation of several different types of budgets. But all of these individual budgets can be classified into two broad categories: operating budgets and financial budgets.	the budgeting process actually requires the preparation of several different types of budgets . but all of these individual budgets can be classified into two broad categories : operating budgets and financial budgets .
Operating budgets are budgets that identify projected sales and production goals and the various costs the firm will incur to meet these goals.

The preparation of operating budgets begins with the development of a sales budget that provides quarterly estimates of the number of units of each product the firm expects to sell, the selling price, and the total dollar value of expected sales. The sales budget must be created first because many of the production and cost figures that go into other operating budgets depend on the level of sales.	the preparation of operating budgets begins with the development of a sales budget that provides quarterly estimates of the number of units of each product the firm expects to sell , the selling price , and the total dollar value of expected sales . the sales budget must be created first because many of the production and cost figures that go into other operating budgets depend on the level of sales .
Once the sales budget is complete, the budgeted sales level can be used to develop the production budget, the administrative expenses, and the selling expenses budgets. And once the production budget is completed, the information it contains is used to prepare budgets for direct labor costs, direct materials costs, and manufacturing overhead. The final stage in the preparation of operating budgets is the creation of a budgeted income statement. This budget looks much like the income statement we described earlier, but instead of describing the actual results of the firm's past operations, it combines the revenue projections from the sales budget and the cost projections from the other operating budgets, to present a forecast of expected net income.	once the sales budget is complete , the budgeted sales level can be used to develop the production budget , the administrative expenses , and the selling expenses budgets . and once the production budget is completed , the information it contains is used to prepare budgets for direct labor costs , direct materials costs , and manufacturing overhead . the final stage in the preparation of operating budgets is the creation of a budgeted income statement . this budget looks much like the income statement we described earlier , but instead of describing the actual results of the firm 's past operations , it combines the revenue projections from the sales budget and the cost projections from the other operating budgets , to present a forecast of expected net income .
Financial budgets focus on the firm's financial goals and identify the resources needed to achieve these goals. The two main financial budget documents are the cash budget and the capital expenditure budget. The cash budget identifies short-term fluctuations in cash flows, helping managers identify times when the firm might face cash flow problems—or when it might have a temporary surplus of cash that it could invest. The capital expenditure budget identifies the firm's planned investments in major fixed assets and long-term projects. The information from these two financial budgets and the budgeted income statement are combined to construct the budgeted balance sheet. This is the last financial budget; it shows how the firm's operations, investing, and financing activities are expected to affect all of the asset, liability, and owners' equity accounts.	financial budgets focus on the firm 's financial goals and identify the resources needed to achieve these goals . the two main financial budget documents are the cash budget and the capital expenditure budget . the cash budget identifies short - term fluctuations in cash flows , helping managers identify times when the firm might face cash flow problems — or when it might have a temporary surplus of cash that it could invest . the capital expenditure budget identifies the firm 's planned investments in major fixed assets and long - term projects . the information from these two financial budgets and the budgeted income statement are combined to construct the budgeted balance sheet . this is the last financial budget ; it shows how the firm 's operations , investing , and financing activities are expected to affect all of the asset , liability , and owners ' equity accounts .

One common way managerial accountants avoid this problem is to develop a flexible budget for control purposes. A flexible budget is one that isn't based on a single assumed level of sales. Instead, it is developed over a range of possible sales levels, and is designed to show the appropriate budgeted level of costs for each different level of sales. This flexibility enables managers to make more meaningful comparisons between actual costs and budgeted costs.	one common way managerial accountants avoid this problem is to develop a flexible budget for control purposes . a flexible budget is one that is n't based on a single assumed level of sales . instead , it is developed over a range of possible sales levels , and is designed to show the appropriate budgeted level of costs for each different level of sales . this flexibility enables managers to make more meaningful comparisons between actual costs and budgeted costs .
The budget process, as we've described it so far, results in a static budget, meaning that it is based on a single assumed level of sales. Static budgets are excellent tools for planning, but they have weaknesses when they are used to measure progress, evaluate performance, and identify problem areas that need correcting.	the budget process , as we 've described it so far , results in a static budget , meaning that it is based on a single assumed level of sales . static budgets are excellent tools for planning , but they have weaknesses when they are used to measure progress , evaluate performance , and identify problem areas that need correcting .

Such opportunity costs are often referred to as implicit costs. For example, suppose a couple of lawyers form a partnership and set up their office in a building one of the partners already owns. They feel good about their decision because they don't have to make any out-of-pocket payments for rent. But a good managerial accountant would point out to the partners that they still incur an implicit cost, because	but accountants realize that not all costs involve a monetary payment ; sometimes what is given up is the opportunity to use an asset in some alternative way . such opportunity costs are often referred to as implicit costs . for example , suppose a couple of lawyers form a partnership and set up their office in a building one of the partners already owns . they feel good about their decision because they do n't have to make any out - of - pocket payments for rent . but a good managerial accountant would point out to the partners that they still incur an implicit cost , because

Managerial accountants also distinguish between fixed costs and variable costs. As the name implies, fixed costs don't change when the firm changes its level of production. Examples of fixed costs include interest on a bank loan, property insurance premiums, rent on office space, and other payments that are set by a contract or by legal requirements. Many fixed costs are really only fixed for some “relevant range” of output.	managerial accountants also distinguish between fixed costs and variable costs . as the name implies , fixed costs do n't change when the firm changes its level of production . examples of fixed costs include interest on a bank loan , property insurance premiums , rent on office space , and other payments that are set by a contract or by legal requirements . many fixed costs are really only fixed for some “ relevant range ” of output .

Variable costs are costs that rise (vary) when the firm produces more of its goods and services. As a company ramps up its production, it is likely to need more labor and materials and to use more electrical power. Thus payments for many types of labor, supplies, and utilities are variable costs.	variable costs are costs that rise ( vary ) when the firm produces more of its goods and services . as a company ramps up its production , it is likely to need more labor and materials and to use more electrical power . thus payments for many types of labor , supplies , and utilities are variable costs .
Finally, accountants often want to assign costs to specific cost objects, such as one of the goods or services their firm produces. When they assign costs to s­ pecific cost objects, accountants distinguish between direct costs and indirect costs. Direct costs are those that can be directly traced to the production of the product. For example, the wage payments made to workers directly involved in producing a good or service would be a direct cost for that product.

a firm incurs for plant maintenance, quality control, or depreciation on office equipment are usually classified as indirect costs since they tend to be the result of the firm's general operation rather than the production of any specific product.	a firm incurs for plant maintenance , quality control , or depreciation on office equipment are usually classified as indirect costs since they tend to be the result of the firm 's general operation rather than the production of any specific product .
Direct costs for labor and materials are usually easy to measure and assign, since they have an easily identifiable link to the object. Unfortunately, indirect costs aren't tied in such a simple and direct way to the production of a specific product. In the past, managerial accountants usually relied on simple rules to assign indirect costs to different products—and in some cases they still do. One such approach is to allocate indirect costs in proportion to the number of direct labor hours involved in the production of each product. Under this method, products that require the most labor to produce are assigned the most indirect costs. But while this approach is simple, it can provide very misleading information. There is simply no logical reason for many types of indirect costs to be related to the amount of direct labor used to produce a product.	direct costs for labor and materials are usually easy to measure and assign , since they have an easily identifiable link to the object . unfortunately , indirect costs are n't tied in such a simple and direct way to the production of a specific product . in the past , managerial accountants usually relied on simple rules to assign indirect costs to different products — and in some cases they still do . one such approach is to allocate indirect costs in proportion to the number of direct labor hours involved in the production of each product . under this method , products that require the most labor to produce are assigned the most indirect costs . but while this approach is simple , it can provide very misleading information . there is simply no logical reason for many types of indirect costs to be related to the amount of direct labor used to produce a product .
This approach is more complex and difficult to implement than the direct labor method. Basically, it involves a two-stage process.

Financial capital refers to the funds a firm uses to acquire its assets and finance its operations. Firms use some of their capital to meet short-term obligations, such as paying bills from suppliers, meeting payroll, repaying loans from banks, and paying taxes owed to the government. Other funds are used to finance major long-term investments, such as the purchase of a plant and equipment or the launch of a new product line. And firms need some funds to pay a return to the owners for their investment in the company.	financial capital refers to the funds a firm uses to acquire its assets and finance its operations . firms use some of their capital to meet short - term obligations , such as paying bills from suppliers , meeting payroll , repaying loans from banks , and paying taxes owed to the government . other funds are used to finance major long - term investments , such as the purchase of a plant and equipment or the launch of a new product line . and firms need some funds to pay a return to the owners for their investment in the company .

The emphasis that financial managers place on maximizing shareholder value may seem to conflict with the modern view that a socially responsible firm has an ­obligation to respect the needs of all stakeholders—not just its owners, but also its employees, customers, creditors, suppliers, and even society as a whole.

Similarly, when a firm provides its employees with a good work environment, those employees are likely to have better morale and greater loyalty, resulting in higher productivity and lower employee turnover. And when a company supports its local community through corporate philanthropy or cause-related marketing, the resulting goodwill may boost sales and create a more ­favorable business climate.

One of the most important lessons in financial management is that there is a trade-off between risk and return. In financial management, risk refers to the degree of uncertainty about the actual outcome of a decision. The risk-return trade-off suggests that sources and uses of funds that offer the potential for high rates of return tend to be riskier than sources and uses of funds that offer lower returns.	one of the most important lessons in financial management is that there is a trade - off between risk and return . in financial management , risk refers to the degree of uncertainty about the actual outcome of a decision . the risk - return trade - off suggests that sources and uses of funds that offer the potential for high rates of return tend to be riskier than sources and uses of funds that offer lower returns .

1. Liquidity ratios: In finance, a liquid asset is one that can be quickly converted into cash with little risk of loss. Liquidity ratios measure the ability of an organization to convert assets into the cash it needs to pay off liabilities that come due in the next year.	1 . liquidity ratios : in finance , a liquid asset is one that can be quickly converted into cash with little risk of loss . liquidity ratios measure the ability of an organization to convert assets into the cash it needs to pay off liabilities that come due in the next year .
One of the simplest and most commonly used liquidity ratios is the current ratio, which is computed by dividing a firm's current assets by its current liabilities. Current assets include cash and other assets expected to be converted into cash in the next year, while current liabilities are the debts that must be repaid in the next year. The larger the current ratio, the easier it is for a firm to pay its short-term debts. A current ratio below 1.0 signifies that a company does not have enough current assets to pay short-term liabilities.

For example, the inventory turnover ratio—computed by dividing the firm's cost of goods sold by average inventory levels—measures how many times a firm's inventory is sold and replaced each year. For example, if a company keeps an average of 100 finished widgets in inventory each month, and it sold 1,000 widgets this year, then it turned its inventory ten times. A high turnover ratio is good because it indicates that a firm can continue its daily operations with a small amount of inventory on hand. It's expensive to have unsold inventory sitting on shelves, that is, low inventory turns. Companies with high inventory turns, which replenish inventory levels more frequently, have less cash tied up in inventory, which means those funds can be used elsewhere. However, inventory turnover ratios can be too high. When that happens, the company isn't keeping enough goods in stock, causing stockouts, which frustrates customers and results in lost sales if they take their business elsewhere.	for example , the inventory turnover ratio — computed by dividing the firm 's cost of goods sold by average inventory levels — measures how many times a firm 's inventory is sold and replaced each year . for example , if a company keeps an average of 100 finished widgets in inventory each month , and it sold 1,000 widgets this year , then it turned its inventory ten times . a high turnover ratio is good because it indicates that a firm can continue its daily operations with a small amount of inventory on hand . it 's expensive to have unsold inventory sitting on shelves , that is , low inventory turns . companies with high inventory turns , which replenish inventory levels more frequently , have less cash tied up in inventory , which means those funds can be used elsewhere . however , inventory turnover ratios can be too high . when that happens , the company is n't keeping enough goods in stock , causing stockouts , which frustrates customers and results in lost sales if they take their business elsewhere .

For firms that sell a lot of goods on credit, the average collection period is another important asset management ratio. This ratio is computed by dividing accounts receivable by average daily credit sales. A value of 45 for this ratio means that customers take 45 days (on average) to pay for their credit purchases. In general, the smaller the ratio, the better, since a lower value indicates that the firm's customers are paying for their purchases more quickly. But we'll see in our discussion of working capital management that low collection periods can also have drawbacks. In January 2017, McDonald's average collection period was 20 days, compared to the fast-food industry average of 9 days. Typically, average collection periods under 30 days are considered to be very strong.	for firms that sell a lot of goods on credit , the average collection period is another important asset management ratio . this ratio is computed by dividing accounts receivable by average daily credit sales . a value of 45 for this ratio means that customers take 45 days ( on average ) to pay for their credit purchases . in general , the smaller the ratio , the better , since a lower value indicates that the firm 's customers are paying for their purchases more quickly . but we 'll see in our discussion of working capital management that low collection periods can also have drawbacks . in january 2017 , mcdonald 's average collection period was 20 days , compared to the fast - food industry average of 9 days . typically , average collection periods under 30 days are considered to be very strong .

leveraged firm is one that relies heavily on debt. While the use of leverage can benefit a firm when times are good, a high degree of leverage is very risky. As we mentioned earlier, the extensive use of debt financing by big banks and major Wall Street firms played a major role in the financial meltdown that began during the latter part of the past decade.	leveraged firm is one that relies heavily on debt . while the use of leverage can benefit a firm when times are good , a high degree of leverage is very risky . as we mentioned earlier , the extensive use of debt financing by big banks and major wall street firms played a major role in the financial meltdown that began during the latter part of the past decade .
Leverage ratios measure the extent to which a firm uses financial leverage. One common measure of leverage is the debt-to-asset ratio (sometimes just called the debt ratio), which is computed by dividing a firm's total liabilities by its total assets. If a firm financed half its assets with debt and half with owners' equity, its debt ratio would be 0.5 (or 50%). The higher the debt-to-asset ratio, the more heavily leveraged the firm is. In January 2017, McDonald's debt-to-asset ratio was 83.7%, compared to Starbucks' ratio of 25.1%.

The cash budget is another important financial planning tool. Cash budgets normally cover a one-year period and show projected cash inflows and outflows for each month. Financial managers use cash budgets to get a better understanding of the timing of cash flows within the planning period. This is i­mportant because most firms experience uneven inflows and outflows of cash over the course of a year, which can lead to cash shortages and cash surpluses. For example, the video game industry experiences sizable increases in cash flows when Sony and Microsoft introduce new versions of their PlayStation and Xbox gaming platforms (typically every 3–4 years); when new blockbuster games (such as Madden NFL) are released; and in November and December, during which holiday sales often exceed sales from the rest of the year.7	the cash budget is another important financial planning tool . cash budgets normally cover a one - year period and show projected cash inflows and outflows for each month . financial managers use cash budgets to get a better understanding of the timing of cash flows within the planning period . this is i­mportant because most firms experience uneven inflows and outflows of cash over the course of a year , which can lead to cash shortages and cash surpluses . for example , the video game industry experiences sizable increases in cash flows when sony and microsoft introduce new versions of their playstation and xbox gaming platforms ( typically every 3–4 years ) ; when new blockbuster games ( such as madden nfl ) are released ; and in november and december , during which holiday sales often exceed sales from the rest of the year.7

Even firms with growing sales can experience cash flow problems, especially if many of their customers buy on credit. To meet increasing sales levels, a growing firm must hire more labor and buy more supplies. These workers and suppliers may expect to be paid long before the company's customers pay their bills, leading to a temporary cash crunch.	even firms with growing sales can experience cash flow problems , especially if many of their customers buy on credit . to meet increasing sales levels , a growing firm must hire more labor and buy more supplies . these workers and suppliers may expect to be paid long before the company 's customers pay their bills , leading to a temporary cash crunch .

Once financial managers have identified the amount of financial capital needed to carry out their firm's plans, the next step is to determine which sources of funds to tap. The most appropriate sources of funds for a business depend on several factors. One of the most important considerations is the firm's stage of development. Start-up firms face different challenges and have different needs than more established firms.	once financial managers have identified the amount of financial capital needed to carry out their firm 's plans , the next step is to determine which sources of funds to tap . the most appropriate sources of funds for a business depend on several factors . one of the most important considerations is the firm 's stage of development . start - up firms face different challenges and have different needs than more established firms .

Of the $11 trillion in investment funds held today, $83 billion is held in socially responsible funds that invest in businesses with environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) missions and products. These funds not only invest in socially responsible companies; they actively avoid investing in firms that sell products that green investors see as detrimental to the environment or to society (such as guns, cigarettes, alcohol, and gambling).	of the $ 11 trillion in investment funds held today , $ 83 billion is held in socially responsible funds that invest in businesses with environmental , social , and corporate governance ( esg ) missions and products . these funds not only invest in socially responsible companies ; they actively avoid investing in firms that sell products that green investors see as detrimental to the environment or to society ( such as guns , cigarettes , alcohol , and gambling ) .
The knock on ESG investing is that green products are more expensive and less profitable, so investors often reap lower returns. Critics argue that 65% of ESG funds have achieved below average returns over the last decade, but proponents counter that ESG companies have performed much better in recent years. Indeed, the MSCI KLD Social Index fund has averaged a 15.4% return the last three years, compared to 15.2% for the S&P 500, a standard investment benchmark.	the knock on esg investing is that green products are more expensive and less profitable , so investors often reap lower returns . critics argue that 65 % of esg funds have achieved below average returns over the last decade , but proponents counter that esg companies have performed much better in recent years . indeed , the msci kld social index fund has averaged a 15.4 % return the last three years , compared to 15.2 % for the s&p 500 , a standard investment benchmark .

Suppliers will grant trade credit only after they've evaluated the creditworthiness of the firm. But once they've granted this credit to a company, they generally continue offering it as long as the firm satisfies the terms of the credit arrangements. Trade credit is sometimes called spontaneous financing because it is granted when the company places its orders without requiring any a­ dditional paperwork or special arrangements. The level of trade credit automatically adjusts as business conditions change and the company places larger or smaller orders with its suppliers.	suppliers will grant trade credit only after they 've evaluated the creditworthiness of the firm . but once they 've granted this credit to a company , they generally continue offering it as long as the firm satisfies the terms of the credit arrangements . trade credit is sometimes called spontaneous financing because it is granted when the company places its orders without requiring any a­ dditional paperwork or special arrangements . the level of trade credit automatically adjusts as business conditions change and the company places larger or smaller orders with its suppliers .
Although firms of all sizes use this type of financing, trade credit is a particularly important source of financing for small businesses. The Federal Reserve Board's Survey of Small Business Finances indicates that about 60% of small firms rely on trade credit as a major source of short-term financial capital.10	although firms of all sizes use this type of financing , trade credit is a particularly important source of financing for small businesses . the federal reserve board 's survey of small business finances indicates that about 60 % of small firms rely on trade credit as a major source of short - term financial capital.10
Factoring The money that customers owe a firm when they buy on credit shows up in accounts receivable on the company's balance sheet. A factor buys the accounts receivables of other firms. The factor makes a profit by purchasing the receivables at a discount and collecting the full amount from the firm's customers.	factoring the money that customers owe a firm when they buy on credit shows up in accounts receivable on the company 's balance sheet . a factor buys the accounts receivables of other firms . the factor makes a profit by purchasing the receivables at a discount and collecting the full amount from the firm 's customers .

Short-Term Bank Loans Banks are another common source of short-term business financing. Short-term bank loans are usually due in 30 to 90 days, though they can be up to a year in length. When a firm negotiates a loan with a bank, it signs a promissory note, which specifies the length of the loan, the rate of interest the firm must pay, and other terms and conditions of the loan. Banks sometimes require firms to pledge collateral, such as inventories or accounts receivable, to back the loan. That way, if the borrower fails to make the required payments, the bank has a claim on specific assets that can be used to pay off the amount due.	short - term bank loans banks are another common source of short - term business financing . short - term bank loans are usually due in 30 to 90 days , though they can be up to a year in length . when a firm negotiates a loan with a bank , it signs a promissory note , which specifies the length of the loan , the rate of interest the firm must pay , and other terms and conditions of the loan . banks sometimes require firms to pledge collateral , such as inventories or accounts receivable , to back the loan . that way , if the borrower fails to make the required payments , the bank has a claim on specific assets that can be used to pay off the amount due .

In exchange for the binding commitment to provide the funds, the bank requires the borrowing firm to pay a commitment fee based on the unused amount of funds. Thus, under the terms of a revolving credit agreement, the firm will pay interest on any funds it borrows, and a commitment fee on any funds it does not borrow. The commitment fee is lower than the interest on the borrowed funds, but it can amount to a fairly hefty charge if the firm has a large unused balance.

Also, since the factor is responsible for collection efforts, the firm using the factor may be able to save money by eliminating its own collection department. Finally, the factor typically assumes the risk for bad debts on any receivables it buys. However, factors typically perform a careful evaluation of the quality of accounts ­receivable before they buy them and may refuse to buy receivables that are high risk.

Commercial paper can be issued for up to 270 days, but most firms typically issue it for much shorter periods— typically 30 days, but sometimes for as little as two days. One key reason commercial paper is popular with companies is that it typically carries a lower interest rate than commercial banks charge on short-term loans. By far the biggest issuers of commercial paper are financial institutions, but other large corporations also use this form of financing.	commercial paper can be issued for up to 270 days , but most firms typically issue it for much shorter periods — typically 30 days , but sometimes for as little as two days . one key reason commercial paper is popular with companies is that it typically carries a lower interest rate than commercial banks charge on short - term loans . by far the biggest issuers of commercial paper are financial institutions , but other large corporations also use this form of financing .
Why use commercial paper? According to the Consumerist, “The commercial paper market works like a credit card for big companies. Some days they have money, and some days they do not. So if they need money Tuesday, but will have money Friday, they'll go to the commercial paper market and borrow some money. Then on Friday they will pay back the money, plus interest.”14 According to the U.S. Federal Reserve, the average rate for 30-day commercial paper was 0.63% in February 2017.15 That means a firm would pay	why use commercial paper ? according to the consumerist , “ the commercial paper market works like a credit card for big companies . some days they have money , and some days they do not . so if they need money tuesday , but will have money friday , they 'll go to the commercial paper market and borrow some money . then on friday they will pay back the money , plus interest . ”14 according to the u.s. federal reserve , the average rate for 30 - day commercial paper was 0.63 % in february 2017.15 that means a firm would pay

Direct Investments from Owners One key source of long-term funds for a firm is the money the owners themselves invest in their company. For corporations, this occurs when it sells newly issued stock—and it's important to realize that the only time the corporation receives financial capital from the sale of its stock is when it is initially issued. If Google issued new shares of stock, which you bought, the funds would go to Google. But once you own Google's stock, if you decide to sell your shares retained earnings The part to ­another investor, Google of a firm's net income it reinvests. gets nothing.	direct investments from owners one key source of long - term funds for a firm is the money the owners themselves invest in their company . for corporations , this occurs when it sells newly issued stock — and it 's important to realize that the only time the corporation receives financial capital from the sale of its stock is when it is initially issued . if google issued new shares of stock , which you bought , the funds would go to google . but once you own google 's stock , if you decide to sell your shares retained earnings the part to ­another investor , google of a firm 's net income it reinvests . gets nothing .
Another way firms can meet long-term financial needs is by reinvesting their earnings. The profits that a firm reinvests are called retained earnings. This source isn't a pool of cash; it simply reflects the share of the firm's earnings used to finance the purchase of assets, pay off ­liabilities, and reinvest in the business.	another way firms can meet long - term financial needs is by reinvesting their earnings . the profits that a firm reinvests are called retained earnings . this source is n't a pool of cash ; it simply reflects the share of the firm 's earnings used to finance the purchase of assets , pay off ­liabilities , and reinvest in the business .
If you want to know how much cash a firm has, check the figure in the cash account at the top of its balance sheet. You'll typically find that the value in the firm's cash account is quite different from the amount listed as the retained earnings! For example, at the end of 2016,	if you want to know how much cash a firm has , check the figure in the cash account at the top of its balance sheet . you 'll typically find that the value in the firm 's cash account is quite different from the amount listed as the retained earnings ! for example , at the end of 2016 ,

Dell bonds would be a sound investment.

This permitted Dell to issue investment-grade bonds, which have significantly lower interest payments.	dell bonds would be a sound investment . working with its bankers , dell showed bond investors that the strong cash flows of the combined companies would easily pay the additional interest associated with new bonds . this permitted dell to issue investment - grade bonds , which have significantly lower interest payments .
Dell Inc. didn't have $60 billion in cash. But together, Dell and EMC had somewhere between $12 billion and $21 billion in cash on their balance sheets.

Dell sold the bonds in stages. By March 2016, it had sold $9.4 billion in investment-grade bonds—$2 billion more than it thought its investors would buy. Encouraged by higher demand, it went back to the markets in May 2016 with $16 billion in investment-grade bonds. Demand from investors was incredible. Dell sold $20 billion in bonds, well short of the $80 billion in orders placed that day.	dell sold the bonds in stages . by march 2016 , it had sold $ 9.4 billion in investment - grade bonds—$2 billion more than it thought its investors would buy . encouraged by higher demand , it went back to the markets in may 2016 with $ 16 billion in investment - grade bonds . demand from investors was incredible . dell sold $ 20 billion in bonds , well short of the $ 80 billion in orders placed that day .

The enormous demand for investment-grade bonds made it easier to sell the final two rounds of debt financing.

One obvious disadvantage of debt is the requirement to make fixed payments. This can create real problems when the firm finds itself in an unexpectedly tight financial situation. In bad times, required interest payments can eat up most (or all) of the earnings, leaving little or no return to the firm's owners. And if the firm is unable to meet these payments, its creditors can force it into bankruptcy.	one obvious disadvantage of debt is the requirement to make fixed payments . this can create real problems when the firm finds itself in an unexpectedly tight financial situation . in bad times , required interest payments can eat up most ( or all ) of the earnings , leaving little or no return to the firm 's owners . and if the firm is unable to meet these payments , its creditors can force it into bankruptcy .
In rough numbers, Dell's $60 billion acquisition of EMC was financed with approximately $20 billion in cash (75% coming from selling off existing businesses) and $40 billion in debt financing (75% coming from investment grade bonds). The new company, Dell Technologies, has 140,000 employees and an estimated revenue of $74 billion a year.22	in rough numbers , dell 's $ 60 billion acquisition of emc was financed with approximately $ 20 billion in cash ( 75 % coming from selling off existing businesses ) and $ 40 billion in debt financing ( 75 % coming from investment grade bonds ) . the new company , dell technologies , has 140,000 employees and an estimated revenue of $ 74 billion a year.22
As we mentioned earlier, another disadvantage of debt financing is that creditors often impose covenants on the borrower. These covenants can hamper the firm's flexibility and might result in unintended problems. For example, a covenant that restricts bonuses and pay raises to employees might undermine the morale of key workers and tempt them to seek employment elsewhere. Similarly, restrictions on dividends or on the ability of the firm to borrow additional funds may make it difficult for the firm to raise more money.	as we mentioned earlier , another disadvantage of debt financing is that creditors often impose covenants on the borrower . these covenants can hamper the firm 's flexibility and might result in unintended problems . for example , a covenant that restricts bonuses and pay raises to employees might undermine the morale of key workers and tempt them to seek employment elsewhere . similarly , restrictions on dividends or on the ability of the firm to borrow additional funds may make it difficult for the firm to raise more money .

Unlike debt, equity imposes no required payments. A firm can skip dividend payments to stockholders without having to worry that it will be pushed into bankruptcy.

On the other hand, equity financing doesn't yield the same tax benefits as debt financing. In addition, existing owners might not want a firm to issue more stock, since doing so might dilute their share of ownership. Finally, a company that relies mainly on equity financing forgoes the opportunity to use financial leverage. But as we've already noted, leverage can be a two-edged sword. We'll illustrate the risks and rewards of leverage in our next section.	on the other hand , equity financing does n't yield the same tax benefits as debt financing . in addition , existing owners might not want a firm to issue more stock , since doing so might dilute their share of ownership . finally , a company that relies mainly on equity financing forgoes the opportunity to use financial leverage . but as we 've already noted , leverage can be a two - edged sword . we 'll illustrate the risks and rewards of leverage in our next section .
As mentioned in our discussion of ratios, firms that rely on a lot of debt in their capital structure are said to be highly leveraged. The main advantage of financial leverage is that it magnifies the return on the stockholders' investment when times are good. Its main disadvantage is that it also reduces the financial return to stockholders when times are bad.	as mentioned in our discussion of ratios , firms that rely on a lot of debt in their capital structure are said to be highly leveraged . the main advantage of financial leverage is that it magnifies the return on the stockholders ' investment when times are good . its main disadvantage is that it also reduces the financial return to stockholders when times are bad .

A company must have cash to pay its workers, suppliers, creditors, and taxes. Many firms also need cash to pay dividends. And most firms also want to hold enough cash to meet unexpected contingencies. But cash has one serious shortcoming compared to other assets: it earns little or no return. If a firm holds much more cash than needed to meet its required payments, stockholders are likely to ask why the excess cash isn't being invested in more profitable assets. And if the firm can't find a profitable way to invest the money, the stockholders are likely to ask management why it doesn't use the excess cash to pay them a higher dividend—most shareholders can think of plenty of ways they'd like to use the cash!	a company must have cash to pay its workers , suppliers , creditors , and taxes . many firms also need cash to pay dividends . and most firms also want to hold enough cash to meet unexpected contingencies . but cash has one serious shortcoming compared to other assets : it earns little or no return . if a firm holds much more cash than needed to meet its required payments , stockholders are likely to ask why the excess cash is n't being invested in more profitable assets . and if the firm ca n't find a profitable way to invest the money , the stockholders are likely to ask management why it does n't use the excess cash to pay them a higher dividend — most shareholders can think of plenty of ways they 'd like to use the cash !

Similarly, setting high credit standards reduces the likelihood a firm will have problems with customers who pay late (or not at all). However, strict standards may prevent many good customers from getting credit, resulting in lower sales. Finally, an aggressive collection policy may help the firm collect payments that it would otherwise lose.

Financial managers measure the benefits and costs of longterm investment proposals in terms of the cash flows they generate. These cash flows are likely to be negative at the start of a project because money must be spent to get a long-term investment project up and running before it begins generating positive cash flows. But a project must eventually generate enough positive cash flows to more capital budgeting The than offset these negative process a firm uses to evaluate initial cash outflows if it is to long-term investment proposals. benefit the company.	financial managers measure the benefits and costs of longterm investment proposals in terms of the cash flows they generate . these cash flows are likely to be negative at the start of a project because money must be spent to get a long - term investment project up and running before it begins generating positive cash flows . but a project must eventually generate enough positive cash flows to more capital budgeting the than offset these negative process a firm uses to evaluate initial cash outflows if it is to long - term investment proposals . benefit the company .

One of the most challenging aspects of the evaluation of a long-term project's cash flows is that they are spread out over a number of years. When financial managers compare cash flows that occur at different times, they must take the time value of money into account.

These lessons from the recent past will probably result in a different approach to financial management over the next several years. While memories of the Great Recession are still relatively fresh, firms may be more conservative in their view of what constitutes the best sources and uses of funds. In particular, they are likely to shy away from excessive debt and put more emphasis on equity financing.

The basic function of financial markets is to transfer funds from savers, who invest to earn financial returns, to borrowers, who need funds to achieve financial goals. Toward the end of economic expansions (which typically last 6–7 years), however, savers and borrowers often become overly optimistic. When that happens, savers increasingly put funds into riskier investments, and borrowers, overconfident in themselves and their plans, borrow too much!	the basic function of financial markets is to transfer funds from savers , who invest to earn financial returns , to borrowers , who need funds to achieve financial goals . toward the end of economic expansions ( which typically last 6–7 years ) , however , savers and borrowers often become overly optimistic . when that happens , savers increasingly put funds into riskier investments , and borrowers , overconfident in themselves and their plans , borrow too much !
According to investment banker Andrew Lawrence, booms in skyscraper construction often occur at the ends of economic expansions or the starts of economic crashes. For example, planning for the Empire State Building coincided with the start of the Great Depression in 1929. In 1996, completion of the Petronas Towers in Malaysia preceded the 1997 Asian financial crisis. Dubai's Burj Khalifa, started in 2004 and completed in 2009, coincided with the end of an economic expansion and the start of the Great Recession in 2008. This skyscraper curse is ostensibly a sign of over-investing and over-borrowing.	according to investment banker andrew lawrence , booms in skyscraper construction often occur at the ends of economic expansions or the starts of economic crashes . for example , planning for the empire state building coincided with the start of the great depression in 1929 . in 1996 , completion of the petronas towers in malaysia preceded the 1997 asian financial crisis . dubai 's burj khalifa , started in 2004 and completed in 2009 , coincided with the end of an economic expansion and the start of the great recession in 2008 . this skyscraper curse is ostensibly a sign of over - investing and over - borrowing .

Congress responded to the stock market crash that occurred in 1929 with two laws that are still the foundation of U.S. securities markets regulation. The first of these was the Securities Act of 1933, which dealt mainly with the process of issuing new securities. It prohibited misrepresentation or other forms of fraud in the sale of newly issued stocks and bonds. It also required firms issuing new stock in a public offering to file a registration statement with the SEC. The next year, Congress passed the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, which regulated the trading of previously issued securities.

The passage of these laws ushered in a period of more stable financial markets. But critics argued that the laws—especially the Glass-Steagall Act—represented an onerous government intrusion into the financial sector that stifled competition and impeded financial innovation.

Congress reacted to the accounting scandals in the first years of the new century by passing the SarbanesOxley Act in 2002. This law included provisions to ensure that external auditors offered fair, unbiased opinions when they examined a company's financial statements. It also increased the SEC's authority to regulate financial markets and investigate charges of fraud and unethical behavior.12	congress reacted to the accounting scandals in the first years of the new century by passing the sarbanesoxley act in 2002 . this law included provisions to ensure that external auditors offered fair , unbiased opinions when they examined a company 's financial statements . it also increased the sec 's authority to regulate financial markets and investigate charges of fraud and unethical behavior.12

Voting Rights: Owners of common stock have the right to vote on important issues at the annual stockholders' meeting. Under the most common arrangement, stockholders can cast one vote for each share of stock they own. One of the key issues that stockholders vote on is the selection of members to the corporation's board of directors, but they also may vote on other major issues, such as the approval of a merger with another firm or a change in the corporation's by-laws. Recall from Chapter 9 that billionaire entrepreneur Elon Musk is CEO of three companies.

Capital Gains: Stockholders receive another type of return on their investment, called a capital gain, if the price of the stock rises above the amount they paid for it. Capital gains can create very attractive financial returns for stockholders. Of course, there is no guarantee the stock's price will rise. If it falls, stockholders would experience a capital loss rather than a capital gain.	capital gains : stockholders receive another type of return on their investment , called a capital gain , if the price of the stock rises above the amount they paid for it . capital gains can create very attractive financial returns for stockholders . of course , there is no guarantee the stock 's price will rise . if it falls , stockholders would experience a capital loss rather than a capital gain .

Right to a Residual Claim on Assets: The final stockholder right is a residual claim on assets. If the corporation goes out of business and liquidates its assets, stockholders have a right to share in the proceeds in proportion to their ownership. But note that this is a residual claim—it comes after all other claims have been satisfied. In other words, the firm must pay any back taxes, legal expenses, wages owed to workers, and debts owed to creditors before the owners get anything. By the time all of these other claims have been paid, nothing may be left for the owners.	right to a residual claim on assets : the final stockholder right is a residual claim on assets . if the corporation goes out of business and liquidates its assets , stockholders have a right to share in the proceeds in proportion to their ownership . but note that this is a residual claim — it comes after all other claims have been satisfied . in other words , the firm must pay any back taxes , legal expenses , wages owed to workers , and debts owed to creditors before the owners get anything . by the time all of these other claims have been paid , nothing may be left for the owners .

Payment of Dividends: Unlike dividends on common stock, dividends on preferred stock are usually a stated amount. And a corporation can't pay any dividend to its common stockholders unless it pays the full stated dividend on its preferred stock.

Preferred stock isn't necessarily “preferred” to common stock in all respects. For instance, preferred stockholders normally don't have voting rights, so they can't vote on issues that come up during stockholders' meetings. And even though preferred stockholders are more likely to receive a dividend, they aren't guaranteed a better dividend; the board can declare a dividend to common stockholders that offers a higher return.17 Finally, when a company experiences strong earnings, the market price of its common stock can—and often does—appreciate more in value than the price of its preferred shares, thus offering common shareholders a greater capital gain.	preferred stock is n't necessarily “ preferred ” to common stock in all respects . for instance , preferred stockholders normally do n't have voting rights , so they ca n't vote on issues that come up during stockholders ' meetings . and even though preferred stockholders are more likely to receive a dividend , they are n't guaranteed a better dividend ; the board can declare a dividend to common stockholders that offers a higher return.17 finally , when a company experiences strong earnings , the market price of its common stock can — and often does — appreciate more in value than the price of its preferred shares , thus offering common shareholders a greater capital gain .

Most bonds require their issuers to pay a stated amount of interest to bondholders each year until the bond matures. The coupon rate on the bond expresses the annual interest payment as a percentage of the bond's par value. For example, investors who own a bond with a par value of $1,000 and a coupon rate of 7.5% receive $75 in interest (7.5% of $1,000) each year until the bond reaches maturity—or until they sell their bonds to someone else.	most bonds require their issuers to pay a stated amount of interest to bondholders each year until the bond matures . the coupon rate on the bond expresses the annual interest payment as a percentage of the bond 's par value . for example , investors who own a bond with a par value of $ 1,000 and a coupon rate of 7.5 % receive $ 75 in interest ( 7.5 % of $ 1,000 ) each year until the bond reaches maturity — or until they sell their bonds to someone else .

bonds—and to pay the bondholder the par value of the bond when it matures. Thus, bondholders are more likely to receive a financial return than stockholders. But that doesn't mean that bonds are without risk. Corporations that get into serious financial difficulties sometimes default on their bonds, meaning that they are unable to make required payments. When that happens, bankruptcy proceedings usually allow bondholders to recover some (but not all) of what they are owed; historically, the average amount recovered has been about 72 cents on the dollar.19 While that is better than what stockholders can expect, it is far short of being risk free. In the 12 months ending in June 2016, 79 U.S. companies, mostly in the energy and mining industries, defaulted on their bonds.20 Moody's, which provides credit ratings for companies, estimated that 2.1% of corporate debt would be defaulted in 2016, up from 1.7% in 2015 and	bonds — and to pay the bondholder the par value of the bond when it matures . thus , bondholders are more likely to receive a financial return than stockholders . but that does n't mean that bonds are without risk . corporations that get into serious financial difficulties sometimes default on their bonds , meaning that they are unable to make required payments . when that happens , bankruptcy proceedings usually allow bondholders to recover some ( but not all ) of what they are owed ; historically , the average amount recovered has been about 72 cents on the dollar.19 while that is better than what stockholders can expect , it is far short of being risk free . in the 12 months ending in june 2016 , 79 u.s. companies , mostly in the energy and mining industries , defaulted on their bonds.20 moody 's , which provides credit ratings for companies , estimated that 2.1 % of corporate debt would be defaulted in 2016 , up from 1.7 % in 2015 and
Corporations sometimes issue convertible securities, which are bonds or shares of preferred stock that investors can exchange for a given number of shares of the issuing corporation's common stock.

Owning a convertible security allows investors to gain from an increase in the price of common stock, while limiting their risk if the price of the stock falls. If the price of the common stock increases, the holders of convertible securities can convert them into the now more valuable stock. But if the price of the company's common stock falls, investors can continue to hold their convertible securities and collect their interest or preferred dividends.	owning a convertible security allows investors to gain from an increase in the price of common stock , while limiting their risk if the price of the stock falls . if the price of the common stock increases , the holders of convertible securities can convert them into the now more valuable stock . but if the price of the company 's common stock falls , investors can continue to hold their convertible securities and collect their interest or preferred dividends .

Many investors who want to hold diversified portfolios find that investing in large numbers of individual stocks and bonds is prohibitively expensive. And even if they could afford to do so, investors often lack the time and expertise to select a large number of individual securities. Faced with these limitations, many investors find that mutual funds and exchange-traded funds are attractive options.	many investors who want to hold diversified portfolios find that investing in large numbers of individual stocks and bonds is prohibitively expensive . and even if they could afford to do so , investors often lack the time and expertise to select a large number of individual securities . faced with these limitations , many investors find that mutual funds and exchange - traded funds are attractive options .
Mutual Funds: Portfolios Made Easy There are two ways mutual funds can be structured.

Shares of closed-end funds can be traded among investors much like stocks. An open-end mutual fund doesn't have a fixed number of shares, nor are its shares traded like stocks. Instead, the fund issues additional shares when demand increases and redeems (buys back) old shares when investors want to cash in.	shares of closed - end funds can be traded among investors much like stocks . an open - end mutual fund does n't have a fixed number of shares , nor are its shares traded like stocks . instead , the fund issues additional shares when demand increases and redeems ( buys back ) old shares when investors want to cash in .

An exchange-traded fund (ETF) is similar to a mutual fund in some respects but differs in how it is created and how its shares are initially distributed. ETFs allow investors to buy ownership in what is called a market basket of many different securities. In fact, the market basket for most ETFs reflects the composition of a broad-based stock index, much like an index mutual fund.

Public Offerings Many corporations are initially owned by a small number of people who don't sell the stock to outsiders. But growing corporations often need to obtain more financial capital than such a small group can provide. Such firms may go public by issuing additional stock and offering it to investors outside their group. The first time a corporation sells its stock in a public offering, the sale is called an initial public offering (IPO).	public offerings many corporations are initially owned by a small number of people who do n't sell the stock to outsiders . but growing corporations often need to obtain more financial capital than such a small group can provide . such firms may go public by issuing additional stock and offering it to investors outside their group . the first time a corporation sells its stock in a public offering , the sale is called an initial public offering ( ipo ) .
Going public is a complicated and high-stakes process; obtaining sufficient funds in an IPO is often critical to the firm's success. So, almost all firms that go public enlist the help and advice of an investment bank that specializes in helping firms issue new securities. The investment bank assists the firm at every step of the IPO, from the planning and market assessment phase until the actual securities are distributed to investors after the offering is conducted.	going public is a complicated and high - stakes process ; obtaining sufficient funds in an ipo is often critical to the firm 's success . so , almost all firms that go public enlist the help and advice of an investment bank that specializes in helping firms issue new securities . the investment bank assists the firm at every step of the ipo , from the planning and market assessment phase until the actual securities are distributed to investors after the offering is conducted .
One of the key responsibilities of the investment bank is to arrange for the actual sale of the securities. The investment bank uses either a best efforts or a firm commitment approach. Under the best efforts approach, the bank provides advice about pricing and marketing the securities and assists in finding potential buyers. But it doesn't guarantee that the firm will sell all of its securities at a high enough price to meet its financial goals.

The main reason private placements are simpler and less expensive than public offerings is that privately placed securities are exempt from the requirement to register with the SEC. The ability to obtain financing without having to prepare complex registration documents can be a real attraction. But because the pool of potential investors is limited to accredited investors, private placements normally don't have the potential to raise as much money as public offerings. Another drawback is that securities that haven't been registered with the SEC can't be sold to anyone except other accredited investors.	the main reason private placements are simpler and less expensive than public offerings is that privately placed securities are exempt from the requirement to register with the sec . the ability to obtain financing without having to prepare complex registration documents can be a real attraction . but because the pool of potential investors is limited to accredited investors , private placements normally do n't have the potential to raise as much money as public offerings . another drawback is that securities that have n't been registered with the sec ca n't be sold to anyone except other accredited investors .

Stock (Securities) Exchanges The stocks of most large publicly traded corporations are listed and traded on a stock (or securities) exchange. A securities exchange provides an organized venue for stockbrokers and securities dealers to trade listed stocks and other securities. Each exchange establishes its own requirements for the securities it lists. The requirements vary among the exchanges, but they're typically based on the earnings of the company, the number of shares of stock outstanding, and the number of shareholders.	stock ( securities ) exchanges the stocks of most large publicly traded corporations are listed and traded on a stock ( or securities ) exchange . a securities exchange provides an organized venue for stockbrokers and securities dealers to trade listed stocks and other securities . each exchange establishes its own requirements for the securities it lists . the requirements vary among the exchanges , but they 're typically based on the earnings of the company , the number of shares of stock outstanding , and the number of shareholders .

Each NASDAQ stock has several market makers who compete against each other by posting two prices for each stock: the bid price indicates how much the market maker will pay per share to buy a stated quantity of the stock, while the ask price indicates the price per share at which it will sell the same stock. The ask price is higher than the bid price; the difference is called the bid/ask spread (or just the spread) and is the source of the market maker's profit.	each nasdaq stock has several market makers who compete against each other by posting two prices for each stock : the bid price indicates how much the market maker will pay per share to buy a stated quantity of the stock , while the ask price indicates the price per share at which it will sell the same stock . the ask price is higher than the bid price ; the difference is called the bid / ask spread ( or just the spread ) and is the source of the market maker 's profit .
The Over-the-Counter Market Many corporations with publicly traded stock don't meet the requirements to have their shares listed on an organized exchange; others choose not to list on exchanges because they don't want to pay the listing fees. The overthe-counter market (OTC) is where the stocks of such companies are traded. OTC stocks are traded through a system of market makers much like stocks are traded on the NASDAQ exchange. However, the market for most OTC stocks is much less active than for stocks listed on the major exchanges. Because of this, most stocks listed on the OTC have only a few market makers.	the over - the - counter market many corporations with publicly traded stock do n't meet the requirements to have their shares listed on an organized exchange ; others choose not to list on exchanges because they do n't want to pay the listing fees . the overthe - counter market ( otc ) is where the stocks of such companies are traded . otc stocks are traded through a system of market makers much like stocks are traded on the nasdaq exchange . however , the market for most otc stocks is much less active than for stocks listed on the major exchanges . because of this , most stocks listed on the otc have only a few market makers .

On the other side of these markets, investors who buy corporate securities do so to acquire assets that they believe will help them achieve their own financial goals. But investing in securities involves risk. Over any short-run time period, there is simply no guarantee that stocks and bonds will provide investors with the returns they expect. The good news—at least if you plan to invest—is that history shows that, over the long run, the return on these securities is positive. Given enough time and patience, investing in stocks and other securities is likely to result in a substantial increase in wealth.	on the other side of these markets , investors who buy corporate securities do so to acquire assets that they believe will help them achieve their own financial goals . but investing in securities involves risk . over any short - run time period , there is simply no guarantee that stocks and bonds will provide investors with the returns they expect . the good news — at least if you plan to invest — is that history shows that , over the long run , the return on these securities is positive . given enough time and patience , investing in stocks and other securities is likely to result in a substantial increase in wealth .

Great Again.” Countless entertainers and athletes have used people marketing to their advantage as well. Consider, for example, Paris Hilton, who appeared to build her early career on promotion alone, eventually parlaying the media attention into a successful line of perfumes and fashion items. Hilton clearly has no doubt about her abilities, declaring, “I am a marketing genius.” In fact, as you pursue your personal goals—whether you seek a new job, university admission, or a Friday night date—people marketing principles can help you achieve your objective. Start by figuring out what your “customer” needs, and then ensure that your “product” (you!) delivers above and beyond expectations.2	great again . ” countless entertainers and athletes have used people marketing to their advantage as well . consider , for example , paris hilton , who appeared to build her early career on promotion alone , eventually parlaying the media attention into a successful line of perfumes and fashion items . hilton clearly has no doubt about her abilities , declaring , “ i am a marketing genius . ” in fact , as you pursue your personal goals — whether you seek a new job , university admission , or a friday night date — people marketing principles can help you achieve your objective . start by figuring out what your “ customer ” needs , and then ensure that your “ product ” ( you ! ) delivers above and beyond expectations.2
Place Marketing: This category involves drawing people to a particular place. Cities and states use place marketing to attract businesses. Delaware, for instance, the second-smallest state in the Union, is home to more than half of the Fortune 500 firms because it deliberately developed a range of advantages for corporations.

Nonprofit organizations—in both the private and public sectors—play a significant role in our economy, employing more people than the federal government and all 50 state governments combined (not to mention an army of volunteers!). These organizations use marketing, sometimes quite assertively, to achieve their objectives. The U.S. Army's marketing communications budget, for example, sometimes approaches as much as $200 million per year. Your own college probably markets itself to both prospective students and potential alumni donors. Private-sector nonprofit organizations also use marketing strategies for everything from marshaling AYSO soccer coaches for kids to boosting attendance at the local zoo, to planning cultural events.1	nonprofit organizations — in both the private and public sectors — play a significant role in our economy , employing more people than the federal government and all 50 state governments combined ( not to mention an army of volunteers ! ) . these organizations use marketing , sometimes quite assertively , to achieve their objectives . the u.s. army 's marketing communications budget , for example , sometimes approaches as much as $ 200 million per year . your own college probably markets itself to both prospective students and potential alumni donors . private - sector nonprofit organizations also use marketing strategies for everything from marshaling ayso soccer coaches for kids to boosting attendance at the local zoo , to planning cultural events.1

Idea Marketing: A whole range of public and private organizations market ideas that are meant to change how people think or act. Recycle, don't drink and drive, buckle your seatbelt, conserve water, support our political party, donate blood, and don't smoke are all examples of popular causes. Often, idea marketing and event marketing are combined, as we see in the annual Avon Walk for Breast Cancer. The planners actively market the idea of annual mammograms, as they solicit contributions for breast cancer research and participation in the event itself.	idea marketing : a whole range of public and private organizations market ideas that are meant to change how people think or act . recycle , do n't drink and drive , buckle your seatbelt , conserve water , support our political party , donate blood , and do n't smoke are all examples of popular causes . often , idea marketing and event marketing are combined , as we see in the annual avon walk for breast cancer . the planners actively market the idea of annual mammograms , as they solicit contributions for breast cancer research and participation in the event itself .

World War II—marriage and birthrates soared. To compete for the consumer's dollar, marketers attempted to provide goods and services that met customer needs better than anything else on the market. As a result, the marketing concept materialized in the 1950s. The marketing concept is a philosophy that makes customer satisfaction—now and in the future—the central focus of the entire organization. Companies that embrace this philosophy strive to delight customers, integrating this goal into all business activities. The marketing concept holds that delivering unmatched value to customers is the only effective way to achieve longterm profitability.	world war ii — marriage and birthrates soared . to compete for the consumer 's dollar , marketers attempted to provide goods and services that met customer needs better than anything else on the market . as a result , the marketing concept materialized in the 1950s . the marketing concept is a philosophy that makes customer satisfaction — now and in the future — the central focus of the entire organization . companies that embrace this philosophy strive to delight customers , integrating this goal into all business activities . the marketing concept holds that delivering unmatched value to customers is the only effective way to achieve longterm profitability .

In marketing terms, the questions become: Who is your target audience, and how will you reach them? Many successful firms answer this question by developing a formal marketing plan, updated on a yearly basis; other firms handle their planning on a more informal basis. But regardless of the specific approach, the first step in planning your marketing strategy should be to determine where to target your efforts. Who are those people who are most likely to buy your products? The first step is market segmentation—dividing your marketing into groups of people, or segments, that are similar to one another and different from everyone else. One or more of these segments will be your target market. Once you've identified your target market, your next step is to determine how you can best use marketing tools to reach them. And finally, you need to anticipate and respond to changes in the external environment.

They may require less service. They refer their friends (and sometimes even strangers).

Demographic B2C demographic segmentation refers to dividing the market based on measurable characteristics about people such as age, income, ethnicity, and gender. Demographics are a vital starting point for most marketers. Chapstick, for instance, targets young women with the Shimmer version of its lip balm, and Chevy Camaro targets young men with money. Sometimes the demographic makeup of a given market is tough to discern; African American artists, for instance, create the bulk of rap music, yet Caucasian suburban males form the bulk of the rap music market.	demographic b2c demographic segmentation refers to dividing the market based on measurable characteristics about people such as age , income , ethnicity , and gender . demographics are a vital starting point for most marketers . chapstick , for instance , targets young women with the shimmer version of its lip balm , and chevy camaro targets young men with money . sometimes the demographic makeup of a given market is tough to discern ; african american artists , for instance , create the bulk of rap music , yet caucasian suburban males form the bulk of the rap music market .

But perhaps the most common type of behavioral segmentation is based on usage patterns. Fast-food restaurants, for instance, actively target heavy users (who, ironically, tend to be slender): young men in their 20s and 30s. This group consumes about 17% of their total calories from fast food, compared to 12% for adults in general. Understanding the usage patterns of your customer base gives you the option of either focusing on your core users or trying to pull light users into your core market.	but perhaps the most common type of behavioral segmentation is based on usage patterns . fast - food restaurants , for instance , actively target heavy users ( who , ironically , tend to be slender ): young men in their 20s and 30s . this group consumes about 17 % of their total calories from fast food , compared to 12 % for adults in general . understanding the usage patterns of your customer base gives you the option of either focusing on your core users or trying to pull light users into your core market .

Yellow suggests happiness and warmth, while orange suggests playfulness, affordability, and fun.

But there is more for marketers to consider than simply color associations. Research shows that the relationship between brands and color hinges on the perceived appropriateness of the color being used for the particular brand (in other words, the color must “fit” what is being sold). Purchasing intent is greatly affected by colors due to the impact that colors have on how a brand is perceived. This means that colors influence how consumers view the “personality” of the brand in question. For example, picture a stick of deodorant targeted at women, and then picture a stick of deodorant targeted at men. Research suggests that men prefer bold colors while women prefer softer ones. Interestingly, blue dominates as the favorite color for both men and women.	but there is more for marketers to consider than simply color associations . research shows that the relationship between brands and color hinges on the perceived appropriateness of the color being used for the particular brand ( in other words , the color must “ fit ” what is being sold ) . purchasing intent is greatly affected by colors due to the impact that colors have on how a brand is perceived . this means that colors influence how consumers view the “ personality ” of the brand in question . for example , picture a stick of deodorant targeted at women , and then picture a stick of deodorant targeted at men . research suggests that men prefer bold colors while women prefer softer ones . interestingly , blue dominates as the favorite color for both men and women .

Nike's approach to marketing in China offers an interesting example of how one firm managed the complex process of building a successful business in a foreign market. When Nike first entered China in the 1990s, the company seemed to face an insurmountable challenge: not only did a pair of Nike sneakers cost twice the Chinese average monthly salary, but most Chinese just didn't play sports, according to Terry Rhoads, then director of Nike sports marketing. So he boldly set out to change that.	nike 's approach to marketing in china offers an interesting example of how one firm managed the complex process of building a successful business in a foreign market . when nike first entered china in the 1990s , the company seemed to face an insurmountable challenge : not only did a pair of nike sneakers cost twice the chinese average monthly salary , but most chinese just did n't play sports , according to terry rhoads , then director of nike sports marketing . so he boldly set out to change that .
Rhoads created a Nike high-school basketball league, which has since spread to 17 cities. To loosen up fans, he blasted canned cheering during games and arranged for national TV coverage of the finals. He even leveraged connections with the NBA to bring Michael Jordan for visits.	rhoads created a nike high - school basketball league , which has since spread to 17 cities . to loosen up fans , he blasted canned cheering during games and arranged for national tv coverage of the finals . he even leveraged connections with the nba to bring michael jordan for visits .

described as an effort to “connect Nike with a creative lifestyle.” Sales in 2011 exceeded $2 billion, driven largely by basketball shoes, although sales began to soften in 2012 and 2013, due to fierce competition and deep discounting. In 2014, Nike continued to lose traction in China, due in part to fierce competition from Adidas. Analysts also pointed out that among other reasons, “Nike's branding is based on encouraging strong identification with iconic sports-stars it uses to endorse its products.

In order for marketers to reach millennials, the United State's largest living generation, they should consider helping them in their quest to shape pop culture. One example of a brand that has done this successfully is Red Bull. The hugely popular energy drink periodically organizes “Flugtag” events in cities around the world.

fun, and the flying machines often don't fly at all. You can certainly see how this event would lead to a huge amount of posting, messaging, and other social media activity. Another high-impact option for marketers is to sponsor events that millennials care about. Bank of America, for example, is a top-level partner in Ocean Conservancy's International coastal cleanup, which sends hundreds of volunteers to remove debris from beaches—a hot-button issue for millennials. Partnering with celebrities or social media influencers can also yield strong results for marketers, assuming that there is a strong fit with their brands.7	fun , and the flying machines often do n't fly at all . you can certainly see how this event would lead to a huge amount of posting , messaging , and other social media activity . another high - impact option for marketers is to sponsor events that millennials care about . bank of america , for example , is a top - level partner in ocean conservancy 's international coastal cleanup , which sends hundreds of volunteers to remove debris from beaches — a hot - button issue for millennials . partnering with celebrities or social media influencers can also yield strong results for marketers , assuming that there is a strong fit with their brands.7
Competitive The dynamic competitive environment probably affects marketers on a day-to-day basis more than any other element. Understanding the competitive environment often begins with analysis of market share, or the percentage of the marketplace that each firm ­controls. To avoid ambushes—and to uncover new opportunities—you must continually monitor how both dominant and emerging competitors handle each element of their marketing mix. And don't forget indirect competitors, who meet the same consumer needs as you, but with a completely different product (e.g., Altoids vs. Scope).	competitive the dynamic competitive environment probably affects marketers on a day - to - day basis more than any other element . understanding the competitive environment often begins with analysis of market share , or the percentage of the marketplace that each firm ­controls . to avoid ambushes — and to uncover new opportunities — you must continually monitor how both dominant and emerging competitors handle each element of their marketing mix . and do n't forget indirect competitors , who meet the same consumer needs as you , but with a completely different product ( e.g. , altoids vs. scope ) .
Economic The only certainty in the economic environment is change, but the timing of expansions and contractions is virtually impossible to predict. Your goal as a marketer is to identify and respond to changes as soon as possible, keeping in mind that a sharp eye sees opportunity even in economic downturns. For instance, affordable luxuries and do-it-yourself enterprises can thrive during recessions.	economic the only certainty in the economic environment is change , but the timing of expansions and contractions is virtually impossible to predict . your goal as a marketer is to identify and respond to changes as soon as possible , keeping in mind that a sharp eye sees opportunity even in economic downturns . for instance , affordable luxuries and do - it - yourself enterprises can thrive during recessions .

Recent research suggests that an overwhelming majority of people around the world care about sustainability. What's more, they are finally willing to put their money where their mouth is and actually buy eco-friendly products—even if they are a little pricier than conventional products or are not quite the same quality. Even so, a surprisingly small number of eco-friendly products have broken through into the mainstream in a significant way. One example of a big success is hybrid cars. The reason may be that hybrid cars answer the age-old question of “What's in it for me?” While most eco-friendly products offer broad planetary benefits such as cleaner oceans or more trees or cleaner air, they don't offer direct personal benefits. Hybrid cars offer planetary benefits, to be sure, but they also offer the direct personal benefits of better gas mileage and a highly visible symbol that tells the rest of the world that the driver has adopted an eco-friendly technology (and is paying a little extra to do so). There is much to be said for appealing to our better intentions and higher purpose, but perhaps there is more marketing success to be had in promising customers direct personal benefits. Unilever's sustainable living hub expands on this idea:	recent research suggests that an overwhelming majority of people around the world care about sustainability . what 's more , they are finally willing to put their money where their mouth is and actually buy eco - friendly products — even if they are a little pricier than conventional products or are not quite the same quality . even so , a surprisingly small number of eco - friendly products have broken through into the mainstream in a significant way . one example of a big success is hybrid cars . the reason may be that hybrid cars answer the age - old question of “ what 's in it for me ? ” while most eco - friendly products offer broad planetary benefits such as cleaner oceans or more trees or cleaner air , they do n't offer direct personal benefits . hybrid cars offer planetary benefits , to be sure , but they also offer the direct personal benefits of better gas mileage and a highly visible symbol that tells the rest of the world that the driver has adopted an eco - friendly technology ( and is paying a little extra to do so ) . there is much to be said for appealing to our better intentions and higher purpose , but perhaps there is more marketing success to be had in promising customers direct personal benefits . unilever 's sustainable living hub expands on this idea :

Observation research can be both cheap and amazingly effective. A car dealership, for instance, can survey the preset radio stations on every car that comes in for service. That information helps them choose which stations to use for advertising. But the biggest downside of observation research is that it doesn't yield any information on consumer motivation—the reasons behind consumer decisions. The preset radio stations wouldn't matter, for example, if the bulk of drivers listen only to their iPods in the car.	observation research can be both cheap and amazingly effective . a car dealership , for instance , can survey the preset radio stations on every car that comes in for service . that information helps them choose which stations to use for advertising . but the biggest downside of observation research is that it does n't yield any information on consumer motivation — the reasons behind consumer decisions . the preset radio stations would n't matter , for example , if the bulk of drivers listen only to their ipods in the car .
Survey research happens when the researcher does interact with research subjects. The key advantage is that you can secure information about what people are thinking and feeling, beyond what you can observe. For example, a carmaker might observe that the majority of its purchasers are men. They could use this information to tailor their advertising to men, or they could do survey research and possibly learn that even though men do the actual purchasing, women often make the purchase decision . . . a very different scenario! But the key downside of survey research is that many people aren't honest or accurate about their experiences, opinions, and motivations, which can make survey research quite misleading.

consumers can “go green” without making any real sacrifices. Environmentally friendly fashion offers another emerging example of green marketing. Over the past few years, a number of designers have rolled out their versions of upscale ecofashion. In addition to clothing made of organic cotton, recent entries include vegan stilettos with four-inch heels, bamboo dresses, biodegradable umbrellas, and solar-powered jackets. (These jackets feature solar cells, integrated into the collar, that collect solar energy and route it to charge devices.)

But technology has also created opportunities for marketers. The Internet has opened the door for mass customization: creating products tailored for individual consumers on a mass basis. Using sophisticated data collection and management systems, marketers can now collect detailed information about each customer, which allows them to develop one-on-one relationships and to identify high-potential new customers. Through the Web, marketers can tap into (or even create) communities of users that yield valuable information about their goods and services.

When most people hear the term “product,” they immediately think of the material things that we buy, use, and consume every day: for example, a can of Pepsi, or a pair of True Religion jeans. But from a marketing standpoint, product means much more. A product can be anything that a company offers to satisfy consumer needs and wants; the possibilities include not only physical goods but also services and ideas. A charity event, cosmetic surgery, and a cooking lesson all qualify as products.	when most people hear the term “ product , ” they immediately think of the material things that we buy , use , and consume every day : for example , a can of pepsi , or a pair of true religion jeans . but from a marketing standpoint , product means much more . a product can be anything that a company offers to satisfy consumer needs and wants ; the possibilities include not only physical goods but also services and ideas . a charity event , cosmetic surgery , and a cooking lesson all qualify as products .

If a “product” includes anything that satisfies consumer needs, services clearly fit the bill. But services have some obvious differences from tangible goods. You often cannot see, hear, smell, taste, or touch a service, and you can virtually never “own” it. After math tutoring, for example, you might possess sharper algebra skills, but you don't own the tutoring experience (at least not literally). Most services embody these qualities:	if a “ product ” includes anything that satisfies consumer needs , services clearly fit the bill . but services have some obvious differences from tangible goods . you often can not see , hear , smell , taste , or touch a service , and you can virtually never “ own ” it . after math tutoring , for example , you might possess sharper algebra skills , but you do n't own the tutoring experience ( at least not literally ) . most services embody these qualities :
Intangibility: You typically cannot see, smell, taste, or touch a service before you buy it. Clearly, this creates a lot of uncertainty. Will the purchase really be worthwhile? Smart marketers mitigate the uncertainty by giving clues that suggest value. For example, the Culver hotel, a funky, old-time showbiz hotel and restaurant, plasters it's walls with pictures of movie stars, and fills its display space with moldering movie artifacts to provide “evidence” of its movie credentials.	intangibility : you typically can not see , smell , taste , or touch a service before you buy it . clearly , this creates a lot of uncertainty . will the purchase really be worthwhile ? smart marketers mitigate the uncertainty by giving clues that suggest value . for example , the culver hotel , a funky , old - time showbiz hotel and restaurant , plasters it 's walls with pictures of movie stars , and fills its display space with moldering movie artifacts to provide “ evidence ” of its movie credentials .

Variability: This one ties closely to inseparability. A talented massage therapist would probably help you relax, whereas a mediocre one might actually create tension. And even the talented massage therapist might give better service at the end of the day than at the beginning, or worse service on the day she breaks up with her boyfriend. Variability also applies to the difference among providers.

A goods and services spectrum can provide a valuable tool for analyzing the relationship between the two. (See Exhibit 12.1.) At one extreme, pure goods don't include any services. Examples include a bottle of ketchup or a package of socks. At the other extreme, pure services don't include any goods. Examples include financial consulting or a piano lesson. Other products—such as a meal at Pizza Hut—fall somewhere between the poles.	a goods and services spectrum can provide a valuable tool for analyzing the relationship between the two .

When customers buy products, they actually purchase more than just the good or service itself. They buy a complete product package that includes a core benefit, the actual product, and product augmentations. Understanding these layers is valuable, since the most successful products delight consumers at each one of them.	when customers buy products , they actually purchase more than just the good or service itself . they buy a complete product package that includes a core benefit , the actual product , and product augmentations . understanding these layers is valuable , since the most successful products delight consumers at each one of them .

The actual product layer, of course, is the product itself: the physical good or the delivered service that­ provides the core benefit. The Samsung Galaxy S8 is an actual good that provides the benefit of communication. A movie theater screening of Wonder Woman is an actual service that provides the benefit of entertainment. Identifying the actual product is sometimes tough when the product is a service. For example, the core benefit of visiting a doctor might be better health, but the actual product may be someone in a white coat pokingand prodding you. Keep in mind that the actual product includes all of the attributes that make it unique, such as the brand name, the features, and the packaging.	the actual product layer , of course , is the product itself : the physical good or the delivered service that­ provides the core benefit . the samsung galaxy s8 is an actual good that provides the benefit of communication . a movie theater screening of wonder woman is an actual service that provides the benefit of entertainment . identifying the actual product is sometimes tough when the product is a service . for example , the core benefit of visiting a doctor might be better health , but the actual product may be someone in a white coat pokingand prodding you . keep in mind that the actual product includes all of the attributes that make it unique , such as the brand name , the features , and the packaging .

While some products have succeeded with little or no forethought, you'll dramatically boost your chance of a hit with careful planning. Product differentiation should be a key consideration. Winning products must embody a real or perceived difference versus the glut of goods and services that compete in virtually every corner of the market. But different alone isn't enough; different from, and better than, the competition are both critical in order to create the shortest path to success.	while some products have succeeded with little or no forethought , you 'll dramatically boost your chance of a hit with careful planning . product differentiation should be a key consideration . winning products must embody a real or perceived difference versus the glut of goods and services that compete in virtually every corner of the market . but different alone is n't enough ; different from , and better than , the competition are both critical in order to create the shortest path to success .

Quality in a product or service is not what the supplier puts in. It's what the customer gets out and is willing to pay for.

Regardless of product category, the two key aspects of quality are level and consistency. Quality level refers to how well a product performs its core functions. You might think that smart companies deliver the highest possible level of performance, but this is seldom profitable, or even desirable. For instance, only a tiny group of consumers would pay for a speedboat to go 200 mph, when 80 mph offers a sufficient thrill (at least for most of us!). The right level of product performance is the level that meets the needs of your consumers, and those needs include price. Decisions about quality level must also consider the competition. The goal is to outperform the other players in your category while maintaining profitability.	regardless of product category , the two key aspects of quality are level and consistency . quality level refers to how well a product performs its core functions . you might think that smart companies deliver the highest possible level of performance , but this is seldom profitable , or even desirable . for instance , only a tiny group of consumers would pay for a speedboat to go 200 mph , when 80 mph offers a sufficient thrill ( at least for most of us ! ) . the right level of product performance is the level that meets the needs of your consumers , and those needs include price . decisions about quality level must also consider the competition . the goal is to outperform the other players in your category while maintaining profitability .

Some companies focus all of their efforts on one product, but most offer a number of different products to enhance their revenue and profits. A product line is a group of products that are closely related to each other in terms of either how they work or the customers they serve. Sony, for example, carries a wide range of digital cameras and accessories, to meet the needs of as many different customers as possible. A product mix is the total number of product lines and individual items sold by a single firm.	some companies focus all of their efforts on one product , but most offer a number of different products to enhance their revenue and profits . a product line is a group of products that are closely related to each other in terms of either how they work or the customers they serve . sony , for example , carries a wide range of digital cameras and accessories , to meet the needs of as many different customers as possible . a product mix is the total number of product lines and individual items sold by a single firm .

Decisions regarding how many items to include in each product line and in the overall product mix can have a huge impact on a firm's profits.

Bottom line: great packaging stems from consumer needs, but it usually includes at least a smidge of creative brilliance. Examples include yogurt in a pouch that doesn't need a spoon, soup-to-go that can be microwaved in the can, “anti-theft” clear sandwich bags printed with mold-like green splotches (seriously!), and single-serving baby carrot packets that moms can toss into kids' lunches.	bottom line : great packaging stems from consumer needs , but it usually includes at least a smidge of creative brilliance . examples include yogurt in a pouch that does n't need a spoon , soup - to - go that can be microwaved in the can , “ anti - theft ” clear sandwich bags printed with mold - like green splotches ( seriously ! ) , and single - serving baby carrot packets that moms can toss into kids ' lunches .

For a business to thrive long term, effective new product development is vital. And the process works only if it happens quickly. As technological advances hit the market at breakneck speed, current products are becoming obsolete faster than ever before. The need for speed compounds as hungry competitors crowd every niche of the market. But the rush is risky, since new product development costs can be in the millions, and the success rate is less than a third. Marketers who succeed in this challenging arena devote painstaking effort to understanding their customers, but they also nurture the creativity they need to generate new ideas.

Commercialization: This stage entails introducing the product to the general market. Two key success factors are gaining distribution and launching promotions. But a product that tested well doesn't always mean instant success. The VW Beetle, for example, sold only 330 cars during its first year in the United States, but it later became a hit.	commercialization : this stage entails introducing the product to the general market . two key success factors are gaining distribution and launching promotions . but a product that tested well does n't always mean instant success . the vw beetle , for example , sold only 330 cars during its first year in the united states , but it later became a hit .
In order to become a commercial success, new products must spread throughout a market after they are introduced. That process is called diffusion. But diffusion clearly happens at different speeds, depending on the individual consumer and on the product itself.	in order to become a commercial success , new products must spread throughout a market after they are introduced . that process is called diffusion . but diffusion clearly happens at different speeds , depending on the individual consumer and on the product itself .
These attitudes clearly affect the rate at which individual people are willing to adopt (or begin buying and using) new products. The first adopters, about 2.5% of the total, are adventurous risk takers. The laggards, about 16% of the total, sometimes adopt products so late that earlier adopters have already moved to the next new thing. The rest of the population falls somewhere in between. Keep in mind that individuals tend to adopt new products at different rates.	these attitudes clearly affect the rate at which individual people are willing to adopt ( or begin buying and using ) new products . the first adopters , about 2.5 % of the total , are adventurous risk takers . the laggards , about 16 % of the total , sometimes adopt products so late that earlier adopters have already moved to the next new thing . the rest of the population falls somewhere in between . keep in mind that individuals tend to adopt new products at different rates .

For example, Apple iPods and Segway Human Transporters appeared on the market around the same time; iPods became a pop culture icon, while Segways remained on the fringe. What accounts for the difference? Researchers have identified five product characteristics that affect the rate of adoption and diffusion. The more characteristics a product has, the faster it will diffuse into the population.	for example , apple ipods and segway human transporters appeared on the market around the same time ; ipods became a pop culture icon , while segways remained on the fringe . what accounts for the difference ? researchers have identified five product characteristics that affect the rate of adoption and diffusion . the more characteristics a product has , the faster it will diffuse into the population .

Maturity: During maturity, sales usually peak. Profits continue to decline as competition intensifies. Once a market is mature, the only way to gain more users is to steal them from competitors rather than to bring new users into the category. Weaker players begin to drop out of the category. Gasoline-powered cars, sugared soda, and network TV are in maturity in the United States.	maturity : during maturity , sales usually peak . profits continue to decline as competition intensifies . once a market is mature , the only way to gain more users is to steal them from competitors rather than to bring new users into the category . weaker players begin to drop out of the category . gasoline - powered cars , sugared soda , and network tv are in maturity in the united states .
Decline: During this period, sales and profits begin to decline, sometimes quite rapidly. The reasons usually relate to either technological change or change in consumer needs. For instance, the introduction of word processing pushed typewriters into decline, and a change in consumer taste and habits pushed hot cereal into decline. Competitors continue to drop out of the category.	decline : during this period , sales and profits begin to decline , sometimes quite rapidly . the reasons usually relate to either technological change or change in consumer needs . for instance , the introduction of word processing pushed typewriters into decline , and a change in consumer taste and habits pushed hot cereal into decline . competitors continue to drop out of the category .

Individual products also have life cycles that usually follow the category growth pattern but sometimes vary dramatically. Clearly, it's in the marketer's best interest to extend the profitable run of an individual brand as long as possible. There are several ways to make this happen: finding new uses for the product, changing the product, and changing the marketing mix. For example, Dancing with the Stars renews interest in their franchise by continually introducing new celebrity contestants.	individual products also have life cycles that usually follow the category growth pattern but sometimes vary dramatically . clearly , it 's in the marketer 's best interest to extend the profitable run of an individual brand as long as possible . there are several ways to make this happen : finding new uses for the product , changing the product , and changing the marketing mix . for example , dancing with the stars renews interest in their franchise by continually introducing new celebrity contestants .
Promotion is the power to influence consumers—to remind them, to inform them, to persuade them. The best promotion goes one step further, building powerful consumer bonds that draw your customers back to your product again and again. But don't forget that great promotion only works with a great product. Bill Bernbach, an ad industry legend, captures this concept by noting, “A great ad campaign will make a bad product fail faster. It will get more people to know it's bad.”	promotion is the power to influence consumers — to remind them , to inform them , to persuade them . the best promotion goes one step further , building powerful consumer bonds that draw your customers back to your product again and again . but do n't forget that great promotion only works with a great product . bill bernbach , an ad industry legend , captures this concept by noting , “ a great ad campaign will make a bad product fail faster . it will get more people to know it 's bad . ”

TV are gleefully changing the schedules and zapping the ads with TiVo or similar devices. As media splinter across an array of entertainment options, usage patterns have changed as well: tech-savvy viewers are more prone to consume media in on-the-fly snacks rather than sit-down meals. Also, services such as Netflix streaming and Hulu Plus have led to an increase in binge viewing of entire seasons of TV shows. Rising consumer power and the breakneck pace of technology have created a growing need—and a stunning opportunity—for marketers to zero in on the right customers, at the right time, with the right message.9	tv are gleefully changing the schedules and zapping the ads with tivo or similar devices . as media splinter across an array of entertainment options , usage patterns have changed as well : tech - savvy viewers are more prone to consume media in on - the - fly snacks rather than sit - down meals . also , services such as netflix streaming and hulu plus have led to an increase in binge viewing of entire seasons of tv shows . rising consumer power and the breakneck pace of technology have created a growing need — and a stunning opportunity — for marketers to zero in on the right customers , at the right time , with the right message.9

Marketing exposure quickly snowballs: the typical consumer receives about 3,000 advertising messages each day. Some of those messages are hard to avoid as marketers find new, increasingly creative ways to promote their products to a captive audience. The venues include elevators, taxicabs, golf carts, and other surprising settings.10	marketing exposure quickly snowballs : the typical consumer receives about 3,000 advertising messages each day . some of those messages are hard to avoid as marketers find new , increasingly creative ways to promote their products to a captive audience . the venues include elevators , taxicabs , golf carts , and other surprising settings.10
Given the confounding level of clutter, smart companies use integrated marketing communication to coordinate their messages through every promotional vehicle—including their advertising, website, and salespeople—creating a coherent impression in the minds of their customers. Why bother coordinating all of these elements? The answer is clear. Consumers don't think about the specific source of the communication; instead, they combine—or integrate—the messages from all the sources to form a unified impression about your product. If the messages are out of sync or confusing, busy consumers won't bother to crack the code. They'll simply move on to the next best option.	given the confounding level of clutter , smart companies use integrated marketing communication to coordinate their messages through every promotional vehicle — including their advertising , website , and salespeople — creating a coherent impression in the minds of their customers . why bother coordinating all of these elements ? the answer is clear . consumers do n't think about the specific source of the communication ; instead , they combine — or integrate — the messages from all the sources to form a unified impression about your product . if the messages are out of sync or confusing , busy consumers wo n't bother to crack the code . they 'll simply move on to the next best option .

But if you accurately identify the key points of contact between your product and your target market, you can focus on those areas with remarkable effectiveness. For instance, the most common points of contact for McDonald's are probably advertising and the in-store experience. From upbeat commercials to smiling employees, to brightly striped uniforms, McDonald's spends millions of dollars to support its core message of fast, tasty food in a clean, friendly environment—heavily concentrated in the areas that are key to its brand.	but if you accurately identify the key points of contact between your product and your target market , you can focus on those areas with remarkable effectiveness . for instance , the most common points of contact for mcdonald 's are probably advertising and the in - store experience . from upbeat commercials to smiling employees , to brightly striped uniforms , mcdonald 's spends millions of dollars to support its core message of fast , tasty food in a clean , friendly environment — heavily concentrated in the areas that are key to its brand .

Even after you've identified the key points of contact, coordinating the messages remains a challenge. In many companies, completely different teams develop the different promotional areas. Salespeople and brand managers often have separate agendas, even when the same executive manages both departments. Frequently, disconnected outside agencies handle advertising, web development, and sales promotion programs. Coordinating the messages will happen only with solid teamwork, which must begin at the top of the organization.	even after you 've identified the key points of contact , coordinating the messages remains a challenge . in many companies , completely different teams develop the different promotional areas . salespeople and brand managers often have separate agendas , even when the same executive manages both departments . frequently , disconnected outside agencies handle advertising , web development , and sales promotion programs . coordinating the messages will happen only with solid teamwork , which must begin at the top of the organization .
Information also plays a crucial role. To coordinate marketing messages, everyone who creates and manages them must have free access to knowledge about the customer, the product, the competition, the market, and the strategy of the organization. Some of this information, such as strategic goals, will come from the top down, but a fair amount, such as information about the customer, should come from the bottom up. Information must also flow laterally across departments and agencies. The marketing research department, for instance, might have critical information about product performance, which might help the web management agency create a feature page that might respond to competitive threats identified by the sales force. When all parties have access to the same data, they are much more likely to remain on the same page.	information also plays a crucial role . to coordinate marketing messages , everyone who creates and manages them must have free access to knowledge about the customer , the product , the competition , the market , and the strategy of the organization . some of this information , such as strategic goals , will come from the top down , but a fair amount , such as information about the customer , should come from the bottom up . information must also flow laterally across departments and agencies . the marketing research department , for instance , might have critical information about product performance , which might help the web management agency create a feature page that might respond to competitive threats identified by the sales force . when all parties have access to the same data , they are much more likely to remain on the same page .

Internet advertising and social media, native advertising is a burgeoning category of advertising specifically designed to mimic the user experience into which it is placed in terms of form and function (picture the “suggested posts” in your Facebook newsfeed that you as a user are much more likely to read and click on than a typical banner ad, or similarly, any of the first few options that come up on a typical Google search). Native ads are often fully integrated into a specific delivery platform, and are not always identified as advertising. They do look like the surrounding editorial content and they typically are relevant to it.

Your face might have looked like a taco if you participated in Taco Bell's wildly successful 2016 Cinco de Mayo promotion with Snapchat. On May 5, 2016, Snapchat featured a special effects lens that allowed users across the country to change their faces into giant tacos. The result was 224 million views in one day, shattering Snapchat's previous record. Snapchat has been relatively slow to move into advertising. CEO Evan Spiegel has indicated some reluctance about sharing user information to better target ads, and parent company Snap insists on keeping some creative control of all advertising. The firm even retains the right to veto projects that it thinks look too much like basic advertising.

Volkswagen (VW) admitted in 2015 that it fit millions of cars with devices to mask the amount of pollutants that they spewed into the environment.

Volkswagen sales plummeted 225%. What's more, the EPA levied fines against VW of up to $37,500 per car—more than the cost of each car affected—amounting to a total penalty of up to $18 billion. It's hard to imagine how the Volkswagen brand will recover, but it may take even longer for overall trust in automobile environmental claims to recover. 30	volkswagen sales plummeted 225 % . what 's more , the epa levied fines against vw of up to $ 37,500 per car — more than the cost of each car affected — amounting to a total penalty of up to $ 18 billion . it 's hard to imagine how the volkswagen brand will recover , but it may take even longer for overall trust in automobile environmental claims to recover . 30

3. Present: You've probably heard that you don't get a second chance to make a good first impression, and that's especially true in sales. With so many options and so little time, buyers often look for reasons to eliminate choices; a weak first impression provides an easy reason to eliminate you. Your presentation itself should match the features of your product to the benefits that your customer seeks (a chance to use all that preparation). Testimonials, letters of praise from satisfied current customers, can push forward the sale by reducing risk for your prospect. A demonstration can be the clincher.

4. Handle Objections: The key to success here is to view objections as opportunities rather than criticism. Objections give you a chance to learn more about the needs of your prospects and to elaborate on the benefits of your product. You should definitely anticipate as many objections as possible and prepare responses. One response may be connecting prospects with others in your company who can better handle their concerns. This approach offers the additional benefit of deepening ties between your prospect and your company.	4 . handle objections : the key to success here is to view objections as opportunities rather than criticism . objections give you a chance to learn more about the needs of your prospects and to elaborate on the benefits of your product . you should definitely anticipate as many objections as possible and prepare responses . one response may be connecting prospects with others in your company who can better handle their concerns . this approach offers the additional benefit of deepening ties between your prospect and your company .
5. Close Sale: Closing the sale—or asking the prospect to buy—is at the heart of the selling process. The close should flow naturally from the prior steps, but often it doesn't—sealing the deal can be surprisingly tough. One approach may be a trial close: “Would you like the 15-inch screen or the 17-inch screen?”	5 . close sale : closing the sale — or asking the prospect to buy — is at the heart of the selling process . the close should flow naturally from the prior steps , but often it doesn't — sealing the deal can be surprisingly tough . one approach may be a trial close : “ would you like the 15 - inch screen or the 17 - inch screen ? ”
If your prospect is still reluctant to buy, you may want to offer another alternative or a special financial incentive. Even if the prospect doesn't actually make the purchase, remember that he or she may be willing in the future, so keep the door open.	if your prospect is still reluctant to buy , you may want to offer another alternative or a special financial incentive . even if the prospect does n't actually make the purchase , remember that he or she may be willing in the future , so keep the door open .
6. Follow-up: The sales process doesn't end when the customer pays. The quality of service and support plays a crucial role in future sales from the same customer, and getting those sales is much easier than finding brand-new prospects. Great relationships with current customers also lead to testimonials and referrals that build momentum for long-term sales success.	6 . follow - up : the sales process does n't end when the customer pays . the quality of service and support plays a crucial role in future sales from the same customer , and getting those sales is much easier than finding brand - new prospects . great relationships with current customers also lead to testimonials and referrals that build momentum for long - term sales success .
Two personal selling trends are gathering momentum in a number of organizations: consultative selling and team selling. Consultative selling involves shifting the focus from the products to the customers. On a day-today basis, the practice involves a deep understanding of customer needs. Through lots and lots of active listening, consultative salespeople offer practical solutions to customer problems—solutions that use their products.	two personal selling trends are gathering momentum in a number of organizations : consultative selling and team selling . consultative selling involves shifting the focus from the products to the customers . on a day - today basis , the practice involves a deep understanding of customer needs . through lots and lots of active listening , consultative salespeople offer practical solutions to customer problems — solutions that use their products .

Team selling tends to be especially effective for large, complex accounts.

A pull strategy involves creating demand from your final consumers so that they “pull” your products through the distribution channels. Many successful brands use a combination of push and pull strategies to achieve their goals.

Wouldn't it be a lot less expensive to buy directly from the producers? The answer, surprisingly, is no. Distributors add value—additional benefits—to products. They charge for adding that value, but typically they charge less than it would cost for consumers or producers to add that value on their own. When distributors add to the cost of a product without providing comparable benefits, the intermediaries don't stay in business. Fifteen years ago, for instance, most people bought plane tickets from travel agents. But when the Internet reduced the cost and inconvenience of buying tickets directly from airlines, thousands of travel agencies lost their customers.	would n't it be a lot less expensive to buy directly from the producers ? the answer , surprisingly , is no . distributors add value — additional benefits — to products . they charge for adding that value , but typically they charge less than it would cost for consumers or producers to add that value on their own . when distributors add to the cost of a product without providing comparable benefits , the intermediaries do n't stay in business . fifteen years ago , for instance , most people bought plane tickets from travel agents . but when the internet reduced the cost and inconvenience of buying tickets directly from airlines , thousands of travel agencies lost their customers .

Distributors add value, or utility, in a number of different ways: form, time, place, ownership, information, and service. Sometimes the distributors deliver the value (rather than adding it themselves), but often they add new utility that wouldn't otherwise be present. As you read through the various types of utility, keep in mind that they are often interrelated, building on each other to maximize value.	distributors add value , or utility , in a number of different ways : form , time , place , ownership , information , and service . sometimes the distributors deliver the value ( rather than adding it themselves ) , but often they add new utility that would n't otherwise be present . as you read through the various types of utility , keep in mind that they are often interrelated , building on each other to maximize value .

Time utility adds value by making products available at a convenient time for consumers. In our 24/7 society, consumers feel entitled to instant gratification, a benefit that distributors can provide more easily than most producers. Consider one-hour dry cleaning, or vending machines at your school. These distributors provide options for filling your needs at a time that works for you.	time utility adds value by making products available at a convenient time for consumers . in our 24/7 society , consumers feel entitled to instant gratification , a benefit that distributors can provide more easily than most producers . consider one - hour dry cleaning , or vending machines at your school . these distributors provide options for filling your needs at a time that works for you .

Wholesalers Many producers sell their goods through multiple channels of distribution. Some channels have many members, while others have only a few. The main distinction among channel members is whether they are retailers or wholesalers. Retailers are the distributors that most of us know and use on a daily basis. They sell products directly to final consumers. Examples include 7-Eleven markets, Starbucks, and Urban Outfitters.

Retailing falls into two main categories: store and nonstore. But as we discuss each type, keep in mind that the lines between them are not always clear. In fact, multichannel retailing—or encouraging consumers to buy through different venues—is an emerging phenomenon. Some marketers have sold their products through multiple channels for many years. For example, on any given day, you could purchase a Coke from a grocery store, a restaurant, or a vending machine. But the emergence of the Internet has provided a host of new opportunities for firms that hadn't previously considered a multichannel approach. An active relationship between on-ground and online outlets has become pivotal for many retailers.	retailing falls into two main categories : store and nonstore . but as we discuss each type , keep in mind that the lines between them are not always clear . in fact , multichannel retailing — or encouraging consumers to buy through different venues — is an emerging phenomenon . some marketers have sold their products through multiple channels for many years . for example , on any given day , you could purchase a coke from a grocery store , a restaurant , or a vending machine . but the emergence of the internet has provided a host of new opportunities for firms that had n't previously considered a multichannel approach . an active relationship between on - ground and online outlets has become pivotal for many retailers .

Despite the advantages, online retailers face two major hurdles. The first is that products must be delivered, and even the fastest delivery services typically take at least a couple of days. But the truly daunting hurdle is the lack of security on the Web.

Vending Until about a decade ago, vending machines in the United States sold mostly soft drinks and snacks. But more recently, the selection has expanded (and the machines have gone more upscale) as marketers recognize the value of providing their products as conveniently as possible to their target consumers. The Maine Lobster Game, for example, allows customers to catch their own fresh lobster dinner with a metal claw in restaurants and bars. But other countries are far ahead of the United States in the vending arena. In Japan, for instance, people buy everything from blue jeans to beef from vending machines. In China, a vending machine at a main subway station in Nanjing sells an average of 200 live hairy crabs every day. And vending machines in Puerto Rico dispense free tubes of Colgate along with candy bars, plus an LED message that says “Don't forget to brush.”8 As technology continues to roll forward, U.S. consumers are likely to see a growing number of vending machines for products as diverse as “fresh-baked” pizza, digital cameras, and specialty coffee drinks.	vending until about a decade ago , vending machines in the united states sold mostly soft drinks and snacks . but more recently , the selection has expanded ( and the machines have gone more upscale ) as marketers recognize the value of providing their products as conveniently as possible to their target consumers . the maine lobster game , for example , allows customers to catch their own fresh lobster dinner with a metal claw in restaurants and bars . but other countries are far ahead of the united states in the vending arena . in japan , for instance , people buy everything from blue jeans to beef from vending machines . in china , a vending machine at a main subway station in nanjing sells an average of 200 live hairy crabs every day . and vending machines in puerto rico dispense free tubes of colgate along with candy bars , plus an led message that says “ do n't forget to brush . ”8 as technology continues to roll forward , u.s. consumers are likely to see a growing number of vending machines for products as diverse as “ fresh - baked ” pizza , digital cameras , and specialty coffee drinks .

At one time, relationships among the members of the supply chain were contentious. But these days, companies that foster collaboration, rather than competition, have typically experienced more success. Vendor-managed inventory is an emerging strategy—pioneered by Walmart—that allows suppliers to determine buyer needs and automatically ship product. This strategy saves time and money but also requires an extraordinary level of trust and information-sharing among members of the supply chain.	at one time , relationships among the members of the supply chain were contentious . but these days , companies that foster collaboration , rather than competition , have typically experienced more success . vendor - managed inventory is an emerging strategy — pioneered by walmart — that allows suppliers to determine buyer needs and automatically ship product . this strategy saves time and money but also requires an extraordinary level of trust and information - sharing among members of the supply chain .

Moving products through the supply chain is so important that it deserves its own section. The various options—trains, planes, and railroads, for instance—are called modes of transportation. To make smart decisions, marketers must consider what each mode offers in terms of cost, speed, dependability, flexibility, availability, and frequency of shipments. The right choice depends on the needs of the business and on the product itself. See Exhibit 13.4 for a description of the transportation options.	moving products through the supply chain is so important that it deserves its own section . the various options — trains , planes , and railroads , for instance — are called modes of transportation . to make smart decisions , marketers must consider what each mode offers in terms of cost , speed , dependability , flexibility , availability , and frequency of shipments . the right choice depends on the needs of the business and on the product itself . see exhibit 13.4 for a description of the transportation options .

Since long-term profitability is a fundamental goal of most businesses, profitability targets are often the starting point for pricing strategies. Many firms express these goals in terms of either return on investment (ROI) or return on sales (ROS). Keep in mind that profitability is the positive difference between revenue (or total sales) and costs. Firms can boost profits by increasing prices or decreasing costs, since either strategy will lead to a greater spread between the two. Doing both is tricky, but companies that succeed—such as Apple—typically dominate their markets.	since long - term profitability is a fundamental goal of most businesses , profitability targets are often the starting point for pricing strategies . many firms express these goals in terms of either return on investment ( roi ) or return on sales ( ros ) . keep in mind that profitability is the positive difference between revenue ( or total sales ) and costs . firms can boost profits by increasing prices or decreasing costs , since either strategy will lead to a greater spread between the two . doing both is tricky , but companies that succeed — such as apple — typically dominate their markets .
Pricing strategy clearly has a significant impact on the success of any organization. Price plays a key role in determining demand for your products, which directly influences a company's profitability. Most people, after all, have a limited amount of money and a practically infinite number of ways they could spend it. Price affects their spending choices at a more fundamental level than most other variables.	pricing strategy clearly has a significant impact on the success of any organization . price plays a key role in determining demand for your products , which directly influences a company 's profitability . most people , after all , have a limited amount of money and a practically infinite number of ways they could spend it . price affects their spending choices at a more fundamental level than most other variables .
But ironically, price is perhaps the toughest variable for marketers to control. Both legal constraints and marketing intermediaries (distributors) play roles in determining the final price of most products. Marketers must also consider costs, competitors, investors, taxes, and product strategies.	but ironically , price is perhaps the toughest variable for marketers to control . both legal constraints and marketing intermediaries ( distributors ) play roles in determining the final price of most products . marketers must also consider costs , competitors , investors , taxes , and product strategies .
In today's frenetic environment, stable pricing is no longer the norm. Smart marketers continually evaluate and refine their pricing strategies to ensure that they meet their goals. Even the goals themselves may shift in response to the changing market. Common objectives and strategies include building profitability, boosting volume, matching the competition, and creating prestige.	in today 's frenetic environment , stable pricing is no longer the norm . smart marketers continually evaluate and refine their pricing strategies to ensure that they meet their goals . even the goals themselves may shift in response to the changing market . common objectives and strategies include building profitability , boosting volume , matching the competition , and creating prestige .
Companies usually express volume goals in terms of market share—the percentage of a market controlled by a company or a product. Amazon.com, for example, launched with volume objectives. Its goal was to capture as many “eyeballs” as possible, in hopes of later achieving profitability through programs that depend on volume, such as advertising on its site.

Penetration Pricing Penetration pricing, a strategy for pricing new products, aims to capture as much of the market as possible through rock-bottom prices. Each individual sale typically yields a tiny profit; the real money comes from the sheer volume of sales. One key benefit of this strategy is that it tends to discourage competitors, who may be scared off by the slim margins. But penetration pricing makes sense only in categories that don't have a significant group of consumers who would be willing to pay a premium (otherwise, the marketer would be leaving money on the table).

involves offering new products at a premium price. The idea is to entice price-insensitive consumers—music fanatics, for example—to buy high when a product first enters the market. Once these customers have made their purchases, marketers will often introduce lower-priced versions of the same product to capture the bottom of the market. Apple used this strategy with its iPod, introducing its premium version for a hefty price tag. Once it had secured the big spenders, Apple introduced the lower-priced iPod Nanos and Shuffles with a powerful market response. But keep in mind that skimming works only when a product is tough to copy in terms of design, brand image, technology, or some other attribute. Otherwise, the fat margins will attract a host of competitors.	involves offering new products at a premium price . the idea is to entice price - insensitive consumers — music fanatics , for example — to buy high when a product first enters the market . once these customers have made their purchases , marketers will often introduce lower - priced versions of the same product to capture the bottom of the market . apple used this strategy with its ipod , introducing its premium version for a hefty price tag . once it had secured the big spenders , apple introduced the lower - priced ipod nanos and shuffles with a powerful market response . but keep in mind that skimming works only when a product is tough to copy in terms of design , brand image , technology , or some other attribute . otherwise , the fat margins will attract a host of competitors .

Years ago, anyone willing to scour coupons, search for deals, and shop often could make use of the lowest prices at the grocery store. But those days are disappearing as quickly as your Internet privacy. A number of large grocers are now implementing personalized pricing programs that create unique offers and prices tailored to shoppers' individual behaviors and needs, ultimately bumping up the grocers' profit margins. Soon, such personalized pricing programs might well displace standardized price tags.

Gasoline uses odd pricing to 99/100ths of a cent. But wouldn't round numbers be easier? Does that extra penny really make a difference? While the research is inconclusive, many marketers believe that jumping up to the “next” round number sends a message that prices have hit a whole new level. In other words, they believe that the perceived gap between $99.99 and $100.00 is much greater than the actual gap of 0.0001%.

Distribution and pricing are two fundamental elements of the marketing mix. In today's frenzied global economy, marketers are seeking a competitive edge through distribution management. Creating a profitable presence in multiple retail venues requires constant focus throughout the organization. And managing the supply chain—how products move along the path from raw materials to the final consumer—plays a crucial role in controlling costs and providing great customer service. Integrating effective technology during the entire process can separate the winners from the losers.	distribution and pricing are two fundamental elements of the marketing mix . in today 's frenzied global economy , marketers are seeking a competitive edge through distribution management . creating a profitable presence in multiple retail venues requires constant focus throughout the organization . and managing the supply chain — how products move along the path from raw materials to the final consumer — plays a crucial role in controlling costs and providing great customer service . integrating effective technology during the entire process can separate the winners from the losers .

All three categories of skill are essential for management success. But their importance varies according to the level of the manager. Front-line managers must have a high degree of technical skills, which help them hire, train, and evaluate employees; avoid mistakes; and ensure high-quality production. Middle-level managers need an especially high level of human skills. They typically act as the bridge between departments, coordinating people and projects that sometimes have mismatched priorities. Top-level managers must demonstrate excellent conceptual skills in order to formulate a vision, interpret marketplace trends, and plan for the future. To move up in an organization, managers must constantly learn and grow, nurturing skills that reflect their new tasks.	all three categories of skill are essential for management success . but their importance varies according to the level of the manager . front - line managers must have a high degree of technical skills , which help them hire , train , and evaluate employees ; avoid mistakes ; and ensure high - quality production . middle - level managers need an especially high level of human skills . they typically act as the bridge between departments , coordinating people and projects that sometimes have mismatched priorities . top - level managers must demonstrate excellent conceptual skills in order to formulate a vision , interpret marketplace trends , and plan for the future . to move up in an organization , managers must constantly learn and grow , nurturing skills that reflect their new tasks .

But after physiological and safety needs are met, the other needs are motivating to different degrees in different people. An employee with strong social connections outside work might be more motivated by a promotion that meets esteem needs than by a company outing that meets social needs. A number of firms actually use self-actualization needs as a starting point for motivating employees, by creating a mission statement that communicates the importance of the work. The House of Blues inspires employees through its lofty purpose: to promote racial and spiritual harmony through love, peace, truth, righteousness, and nonviolence.	but after physiological and safety needs are met , the other needs are motivating to different degrees in different people . an employee with strong social connections outside work might be more motivated by a promotion that meets esteem needs than by a company outing that meets social needs . a number of firms actually use self - actualization needs as a starting point for motivating employees , by creating a mission statement that communicates the importance of the work . the house of blues inspires employees through its lofty purpose : to promote racial and spiritual harmony through love , peace , truth , righteousness , and nonviolence .

Companies today use a range of approaches to motivation, although several key themes have emerged. Most firms no longer seek to make their employees happy; instead, they want their workers to be productive and engaged. Yet, for employees, work is about more than just productivity. University of Michigan business school professor David Ulrich points out that even in today's hyper-competitive environment, “people still want to find meaning in their work and in the institutions that employ them.”7	companies today use a range of approaches to motivation , although several key themes have emerged . most firms no longer seek to make their employees happy ; instead , they want their workers to be productive and engaged . yet , for employees , work is about more than just productivity . university of michigan business school professor david ulrich points out that even in today 's hyper - competitive environment , “ people still want to find meaning in their work and in the institutions that employ them . ”7

Under the direction of hard-driving CEO Travis Kalanick, ride share behemoth Uber took its hustle-oriented culture to an extreme, resulting in a toxic, macho environment that led to a raft of lawsuits, executive firings, disgruntled employees, and ultimately, a loss of revenue. According to some sources, hiring managers in the Bay Area have begun evaluating once highly sought-after applicants from Uber with a new degree of skepticism. More and more, a “hustle-oriented culture” has become something to be afraid of. Hustle clearly has value, but it also works best when it is balanced with empathy, respect, and sheer human decency.5	under the direction of hard - driving ceo travis kalanick , ride share behemoth uber took its hustle - oriented culture to an extreme , resulting in a toxic , macho environment that led to a raft of lawsuits , executive firings , disgruntled employees , and ultimately , a loss of revenue . according to some sources , hiring managers in the bay area have begun evaluating once highly sought - after applicants from uber with a new degree of skepticism . more and more , a “ hustle - oriented culture ” has become something to be afraid of . hustle clearly has value , but it also works best when it is balanced with empathy , respect , and sheer human decency.5

Google, which has been on the list for 11 years and in the number one slot for eight years, offers employees a famous set of perks at their Silicon Valley headquarters, including on-site haircutting, massage services, game facilities, and 25 cafés companywide, all free. As one happy Googler writes, “The company culture truly makes workers feel they're valued and respected as a human being, not as a cog in a machine.” Despite—or perhaps in part because of the pricey perks—everything at Google is up: revenue, profits, share price, paid search clicks, and hiring. Googlers nearly uniformly praise the competence of their leadership, the support they receive as professionals, and the pride they take in the challenging work they accomplish together. “Simply by being here,	their employees and to offer strong commitments to make the world a better place . google , which has been on the list for 11 years and in the number one slot for eight years , offers employees a famous set of perks at their silicon valley headquarters , including on - site haircutting , massage services , game facilities , and 25 cafés companywide , all free . as one happy googler writes , “ the company culture truly makes workers feel they 're valued and respected as a human being , not as a cog in a machine . ” despite — or perhaps in part because of the pricey perks — everything at google is up : revenue , profits , share price , paid search clicks , and hiring . googlers nearly uniformly praise the competence of their leadership , the support they receive as professionals , and the pride they take in the challenging work they accomplish together . “ simply by being here ,

“pocket calls.”When Facebook went public, Mark Zuckerberg described the firm's “hack culture” as one of its assets, more specifically, an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration. He added that “hackers believe that something can always be better, and that nothing is ever complete. They just have to go fix it—often in the face of people who say it's impossible or are content with the status quo.” With the “Hacker Way,” the best idea and implementation should always win—not the person who is best at lobbying for an idea or the person who manages the most people.11	“ pocket calls . ”when facebook went public , mark zuckerberg described the firm 's “ hack culture ” as one of its assets , more specifically , an approach to building that involves continuous improvement and iteration . he added that “ hackers believe that something can always be better , and that nothing is ever complete . they just have to go fix it — often in the face of people who say it 's impossible or are content with the status quo . ” with the “ hacker way , ” the best idea and implementation should always win — not the person who is best at lobbying for an idea or the person who manages the most people.11

But even though planning is critical, it's also highly risky in light of cutthroat competition, rapid change, and economic uncertainty. The best plans keep the organization on track without sacrificing flexibility and responsiveness; they incorporate ways to respond to change both inside and outside the organization.12	a survey in the wall street journal found that 80 % of executives identify planning as their most valuable management tool . but even though planning is critical , it 's also highly risky in light of cutthroat competition , rapid change , and economic uncertainty . the best plans keep the organization on track without sacrificing flexibility and responsiveness ; they incorporate ways to respond to change both inside and outside the organization.12

▪▪ Forgetting that millennials differ widely in terms of age and gender. Born between 1982 and 2000, the millennial generation spans a wide range of ages and life cycle stages. A student in his late teens is just as much a millennial as a manager in her mid-thirties. Differences in experience, personal characteristics, and expectations are vast across the generation. Millennials also differ significantly by gender. For example, older and female millennials expect to stay in their current jobs longer than do younger and male millennials, say Bentley University researchers.	▪ ▪ forgetting that millennials differ widely in terms of age and gender . born between 1982 and 2000 , the millennial generation spans a wide range of ages and life cycle stages . a student in his late teens is just as much a millennial as a manager in her mid - thirties . differences in experience , personal characteristics , and expectations are vast across the generation . millennials also differ significantly by gender . for example , older and female millennials expect to stay in their current jobs longer than do younger and male millennials , say bentley university researchers .

The underlying aim, of course, is to create a significant advantage versus the competition.

SWOT analysis determines the starting point, and the objectives signify the immediate destination. Since speed matters, you must begin mapping the next leg of the journey even before you arrive. For added complexity, you never know—given the turbulent environment—when you might hit roadblocks. This means that strategies must be dynamic and flexible.

Middle managers in each key area of the company must develop plans to carry out core strategies in their area. If the strategic plan, for example, calls for more new products, marketing would need to generate ideas, finance would need to find funding, and sales would need to prepare key accounts.	implementing your strategies implementation should happen largely through tactical planning . middle managers in each key area of the company must develop plans to carry out core strategies in their area . if the strategic plan , for example , calls for more new products , marketing would need to generate ideas , finance would need to find funding , and sales would need to prepare key accounts .

The organizing function of management means creating a logical structure for people, their jobs, and their patterns of interaction. And clearly, the pieces can fit together in a number of different ways. In choosing the right structure for a specific company, management typically considers many factors, including the goals and strategies of the firm, its products, its use of technology, its size, and the structure of its competitors. Given the potential for rapid change in each of these factors, smart companies continually reexamine their structure and make changes whenever necessary. Microsoft, for instance, restructures its organization every couple of years as new challenges emerge.	the organizing function of management means creating a logical structure for people , their jobs , and their patterns of interaction . and clearly , the pieces can fit together in a number of different ways . in choosing the right structure for a specific company , management typically considers many factors , including the goals and strategies of the firm , its products , its use of technology , its size , and the structure of its competitors . given the potential for rapid change in each of these factors , smart companies continually reexamine their structure and make changes whenever necessary . microsoft , for instance , restructures its organization every couple of years as new challenges emerge .
But to be effective, reorganizations—and their purpose—must be clear to employees throughout the company. Xerox CEO Anne Mulcahy learned the hard way. Her comments: “During the 1990s, we had lots of consultants on organizational effectiveness. We sliced and diced the business into industries, product lines, and geographies . . . you name it. It looked good on paper, but fell apart in implementation. I found myself in a job where I couldn't look anybody in the eye and feel clear accountability for anything . . . I'll trade off organizational design for clarity and accountability any day of the week!”14	but to be effective , reorganizations — and their purpose — must be clear to employees throughout the company . xerox ceo anne mulcahy learned the hard way . her comments : “ during the 1990s , we had lots of consultants on organizational effectiveness . we sliced and diced the business into industries , product lines , and geographies . . . you name it . it looked good on paper , but fell apart in implementation . i found myself in a job where i could n't look anybody in the eye and feel clear accountability for anything . . . i 'll trade off organizational design for clarity and accountability any day of the week!”14
To help employees understand how they and their jobs fit within the broader organization, most firms issue an organization chart, or a visual representation of the company's formal structure, as shown in Exhibit 14.8.	to help employees understand how they and their jobs fit within the broader organization , most firms issue an organization chart , or a visual representation of the company 's formal structure , as shown in exhibit 14.8 .
Looking at the company represented by Exhibit 14.8, you would probably assume that the vice president of production has more power than a regular employee in the marketing department. And in terms of formal power, you'd be absolutely right. But if the marketing employee babysits on the weekend for the president's granddaughter, the balance of power may actually be a bit different than it seems. Make no mistake: The formal structure matters. But knowing how power flows on an informal basis could dramatically increase your effectiveness as well, by helping you target your ideas to the right managers and marshal the support of the most influential employees.	looking at the company represented by exhibit 14.8 , you would probably assume that the vice president of production has more power than a regular employee in the marketing department . and in terms of formal power , you 'd be absolutely right . but if the marketing employee babysits on the weekend for the president 's granddaughter , the balance of power may actually be a bit different than it seems . make no mistake : the formal structure matters . but knowing how power flows on an informal basis could dramatically increase your effectiveness as well , by helping you target your ideas to the right managers and marshal the support of the most influential employees .

Partly because of this ethos, in the decade that his firm has been in business, no one has chosen to leave the company. If more CEOs communicated this message, chances are that more vacation time would actually be used. Eighty percent of employees surveyed by Project: TimeOff said that if they felt fully supported and encouraged by their boss, they would be more likely to take more time off. A growing number of high-profile companies, such as Virgin Group and Netflix, are offering employees unlimited or unmonitored vacation days to encourage time off and rejuvenation.15	partly because of this ethos , in the decade that his firm has been in business , no one has chosen to leave the company . if more ceos communicated this message , chances are that more vacation time would actually be used . eighty percent of employees surveyed by project : timeoff said that if they felt fully supported and encouraged by their boss , they would be more likely to take more time off . a growing number of high - profile companies , such as virgin group and netflix , are offering employees unlimited or unmonitored vacation days to encourage time off and rejuvenation.15
Ironically, a growing body of research suggests rather strongly that the best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less, which may include daytime workouts, short afternoon naps, longer sleep hours at night, and longer, more frequent vacations. Despite misguided efforts to make it otherwise, time is definitely finite; energy, on the other hand, can be renewed. A recent study on the economic costs of insufficient sleep (less than six hours per night) found that a lack of sleep among the U.S. workforce is costing businesses about $411 billion in lost productivity each year.	ironically , a growing body of research suggests rather strongly that the best way to get more done may be to spend more time doing less , which may include daytime workouts , short afternoon naps , longer sleep hours at night , and longer , more frequent vacations . despite misguided efforts to make it otherwise , time is definitely finite ; energy , on the other hand , can be renewed . a recent study on the economic costs of insufficient sleep ( less than six hours per night ) found that a lack of sleep among the u.s. workforce is costing businesses about $ 411 billion in lost productivity each year .

Line Organizations A line organization typically has a clear, simple chain of command from top to bottom. Each person is directly accountable to the person immediately above, which means quick decision making and no fuzziness about who is responsible for what. The downside is a lack of specialists to provide advice or support for line managers. This approach tends to work well for small businesses, but for medium-sized and large companies, the result can be inflexibility, too much paperwork, and even incompetence, since line organizations experts aren't available	line organizations a line organization typically has a clear , simple chain of command from top to bottom . each person is directly accountable to the person immediately above , which means quick decision making and no fuzziness about who is responsible for what . the downside is a lack of specialists to provide advice or support for line managers . this approach tends to work well for small businesses , but for medium - sized and large companies , the result can be inflexibility , too much paperwork , and even incompetence , since line organizations experts are n't available

Matrix Organizations Matrix organizations build on the line-and-staff approach by adding a lot more flexibility. A matrix structure brings together specialists from different areas of the company to work on individual projects on a temporary basis. A new-product-development team, for instance, might include representatives from sales, engineering, finance, purchasing, and advertising. For the course of the project, each specialist reports to the project manager and to the head of his or her own department (e.g., the vice president of marketing).

While most people easily recognize a great leader, defining the qualities of leaders can be more complex since successful leaders have a staggering range of personalities, characteristics, and backgrounds. Most researchers agree that true leaders are trustworthy, visionary, and inspiring. After all, we don't follow people who don't know where they're going, and we definitely don't follow people we don't trust. Other key leadership traits include empathy, courage, creativity, intelligence, and fairness.	while most people easily recognize a great leader , defining the qualities of leaders can be more complex since successful leaders have a staggering range of personalities , characteristics , and backgrounds . most researchers agree that true leaders are trustworthy , visionary , and inspiring . after all , we do n't follow people who do n't know where they 're going , and we definitely do n't follow people we do n't trust . other key leadership traits include empathy , courage , creativity , intelligence , and fairness .
How a leader uses power defines his or her leadership style. While the range of specific styles is huge, most seem to cluster into three broad categories: autocratic, democratic, and free-rein. The categories fall along a continuum of power, with the manager at one end and the employees at the other, as shown in Exhibit 14.10.	how a leader uses power defines his or her leadership style . while the range of specific styles is huge , most seem to cluster into three broad categories : autocratic , democratic , and free - rein . the categories fall along a continuum of power , with the manager at one end and the employees at the other , as shown in exhibit 14.10 .

Interestingly, the most effective leaders don't use just one approach. They tend to shift their leadership style, depending on the followers and the situation. When a quick decision is paramount, autocratic leadership may make the most sense. An army officer, for example, probably shouldn't take a vote on whether to storm a hill in the middle of a firefight. But when creativity is the top priority—during new-product brainstorming, for instance—free-rein management would probably work best. Likewise, a brand-new worker might benefit from autocratic (but friendly) management, while a talented, experienced employee would probably work best under free-rein leadership.	interestingly , the most effective leaders do n't use just one approach . they tend to shift their leadership style , depending on the followers and the situation . when a quick decision is paramount , autocratic leadership may make the most sense . an army officer , for example , probably should n't take a vote on whether to storm a hill in the middle of a firefight . but when creativity is the top priority — during new - product brainstorming , for instance — free - rein management would probably work best . likewise , a brand - new worker might benefit from autocratic ( but friendly ) management , while a talented , experienced employee would probably work best under free - rein leadership .

As competition accelerates across the globe, leading firms in every business category have recognized that a quality workforce can vault them over the competition. Southwest Airlines was early to recognize the untapped potential of its people. Executive Chair Herb Kelleher declared, “We value our employees first. They're the most important, and if you treat them right, then they treat the customers right, and if you treat the customers right, then they keep coming back and shareholders are happy.” His attitude has more than paid off. Southwest Airlines has posted profits for 44 consecutive years, even as other airlines have spiraled into decline.	as competition accelerates across the globe , leading firms in every business category have recognized that a quality workforce can vault them over the competition . southwest airlines was early to recognize the untapped potential of its people . executive chair herb kelleher declared , “ we value our employees first . they 're the most important , and if you treat them right , then they treat the customers right , and if you treat the customers right , then they keep coming back and shareholders are happy . ” his attitude has more than paid off . southwest airlines has posted profits for 44 consecutive years , even as other airlines have spiraled into decline .

But several large-scale studies confirm that women continue to face daunting discrimination in terms of both pay and promotions. While unfair treatment has been an issue for many years, recent legal changes have made it easier for women to sue, costing companies millions of dollars in the past decade alone.

(the latest available data), women earned $0.83 for every dollar that men earned. Although the pay gap is better today than it was in 1980, it's still not ideal. At this rate, it would take a woman an extra 44 days of work to earn what a man does in one year. However, it's not all bad news. In 2015, young women saw a smaller pay gap than average, earning $0.90 for every dollar that their male counterparts earned. This still isn't perfect—but it's definitely better. So why, at this point in the twenty-first century, is there a pay gap at all between men and women?

­genders have actively pursued more flexibility and work–life balance in their jobs. But as the recession deepened in 2009, companies began to cut back on these initiatives, describing them as “nice to have” programs in a time when “need to have” goals—such as meeting payroll each month—are tough to attain. Middle-level managers are also apt to demonstrate bias against worker flexibility, even when top management actively supports work–life balance programs. In spite of these issues, insightful HR managers try hard to offer enough flexibility to keep their best workers without jeopardizing their company's business goals.10	­genders have actively pursued more flexibility and work – life balance in their jobs . but as the recession deepened in 2009 , companies began to cut back on these initiatives , describing them as “ nice to have ” programs in a time when “ need to have ” goals — such as meeting payroll each month — are tough to attain . middle - level managers are also apt to demonstrate bias against worker flexibility , even when top management actively supports work – life balance programs . in spite of these issues , insightful hr managers try hard to offer enough flexibility to keep their best workers without jeopardizing their company 's business goals.10

To gain respect from both senior management and their peers, human resources executives must earn a seat at the table. The first step is to know the company. What are the strategic goals? Who is the core customer? Who is the competition? Respected HR departments typically figure out ways to quantify their impact on the company in dollars and cents. They determine how to raise the value of the firm's human capital, which in turn increases the value of the firm itself. Effective HR people also remain open to exceptions even as they enforce broad company policies.	to gain respect from both senior management and their peers , human resources executives must earn a seat at the table . the first step is to know the company . what are the strategic goals ? who is the core customer ? who is the competition ? respected hr departments typically figure out ways to quantify their impact on the company in dollars and cents . they determine how to raise the value of the firm 's human capital , which in turn increases the value of the firm itself . effective hr people also remain open to exceptions even as they enforce broad company policies .

One of the first steps in the HR planning process should be to figure out where the company stands in terms of human resources. What skills does the workforce already have? What skills does it need? A companywide job ­analysis often goes hand in hand with evaluating the current workforce. Job analysis examines what exactly needs to be done in each position to maximize the effectiveness of the organization—independent of who might be holding each job at any specific time. Smaller companies often handle job analysis on an informal basis, but larger companies typically specify a formal job descrip­tion and job specifications (or “specs”).	one of the first steps in the hr planning process should be to figure out where the company stands in terms of human resources . what skills does the workforce already have ? what skills does it need ? a companywide job ­analysis often goes hand in hand with evaluating the current workforce . job analysis examines what exactly needs to be done in each position to maximize the effectiveness of the organization — independent of who might be holding each job at any specific time . smaller companies often handle job analysis on an informal basis , but larger companies typically specify a formal job descrip­tion and job specifications ( or “ specs ” ) .

The next step is to forecast future human resource requirements. The forecasting function requires a deep understanding of the company's goals and strategies. HR managers must also assess the future supply of workers. Assessing supply can be a real challenge, since the size and quality of the workforce shift continually. But key considerations should include retirement rates, graduation rates in relevant fields, and the pros and cons of the international labor market.	the next step is to forecast future human resource requirements . the forecasting function requires a deep understanding of the company 's goals and strategies . hr managers must also assess the future supply of workers . assessing supply can be a real challenge , since the size and quality of the workforce shift continually . but key considerations should include retirement rates , graduation rates in relevant fields , and the pros and cons of the international labor market .

External recruitment, or looking for employees outside the firm, usually means tapping into a range of different resources. The possibilities include employment websites, newspaper ads, job fairs, trade associations, college and university employment centers, and employment agencies. But the most promising source of new hires may be referrals from current employees. A growing number of organizations offer their current employees a cash bonus— typically $1,000 to $2,000—for each person they refer to the company who makes it past a probationary period.

Once you have a pool of qualified candidates, your next step is to choose the best person for the job. This, too, is more easily said than done, yet making the right selection is crucial. The costs of a bad hire—both the direct costs such as placing ads, and the intangibles such as lost productivity and morale—can drain company resources. A typical selection process includes accepting applications, interviewing, testing, checking references and background, and making the job offer. Keep in mind that small businesses often follow a more streamlined process.	once you have a pool of qualified candidates , your next step is to choose the best person for the job . this , too , is more easily said than done , yet making the right selection is crucial . the costs of a bad hire — both the direct costs such as placing ads , and the intangibles such as lost productivity and morale — can drain company resources . a typical selection process includes accepting applications , interviewing , testing , checking references and background , and making the job offer . keep in mind that small businesses often follow a more streamlined process .

Although employers frequently give interviews heavy weight in hiring decisions, interviews often say surprisingly little about whether a candidate will perform on the job. Too many managers use the interview as a get-to-know-you session rather than focusing on the needs of the position. To help ensure that interviews better predict performance, experts recommend a structured interview process: developing a list of questions beforehand and asking the same questions to each candidate. The most effective questions are typically behavioral: they ask the candidate to describe a situation that he or she faced at a previous job—or a hypothetical situation at the new job—and to explain the resolution.

Research from the Society for Human Resource Managers suggests that more than 50% of job candidates lie on their résumé in some way. Although it may be tough to verify contributions and accomplishments at former jobs, it's pretty easy to uncover lies about education, job titles, and compensation. And it's quite worthwhile, given that the costs of bringing an unethical employee on board can be staggering. Furthermore, if you happen to hire a truly dangerous employee, you can open the door to negligenthiring lawsuits for not taking “rea­sonable care.” But surprisingly—despite the high risk—employment expert James	research from the society for human resource managers suggests that more than 50 % of job candidates lie on their résumé in some way . although it may be tough to verify contributions and accomplishments at former jobs , it 's pretty easy to uncover lies about education , job titles , and compensation . and it 's quite worthwhile , given that the costs of bringing an unethical employee on board can be staggering . furthermore , if you happen to hire a truly dangerous employee , you can open the door to negligenthiring lawsuits for not taking “ rea­sonable care . ” but surprisingly — despite the high risk — employment expert james

Contingent Workers Companies that experience a fluctuating need for workers sometimes opt to hire contingent workers—or employees who don't expect regular, full-time jobs—rather than permanent, fulltime workers.

Management Development As the bulk of toplevel U.S. executives move toward retirement (or lose their jobs in the recession), developing new leaders has become a priority in many organizations. Management development programs help current and potential executives develop the skills they need to move into leadership positions. These programs typically cover specific issues that the business faces but also less-tangible—yet equally important—topics, such as communication, planning, business-analysis, change-management, coaching, and team-building skills.	management development as the bulk of toplevel u.s. executives move toward retirement ( or lose their jobs in the recession ) , developing new leaders has become a priority in many organizations . management development programs help current and potential executives develop the skills they need to move into leadership positions . these programs typically cover specific issues that the business faces but also less - tangible — yet equally important — topics , such as communication , planning , business - analysis , change - management , coaching , and team - building skills .
Straightforward, frequent feedback is a powerful tool to improve employee performance. The best managers provide informal feedback on a constant basis so that employees always know where they stand. But most companies also require that managers give formal feedback through periodic performance appraisals, usually every six months or once a year. Typically, managers conduct the appraisals by sitting down with each employee on a one-to-one basis and comparing actual results to expected results. The performance appraisal affects decisions regarding compensation, promotions, training, transfers, and terminations.	straightforward , frequent feedback is a powerful tool to improve employee performance . the best managers provide informal feedback on a constant basis so that employees always know where they stand . but most companies also require that managers give formal feedback through periodic performance appraisals , usually every six months or once a year . typically , managers conduct the appraisals by sitting down with each employee on a one - to - one basis and comparing actual results to expected results . the performance appraisal affects decisions regarding compensation , promotions , training , transfers , and terminations .

The term compensation covers both pay and benefits, but when most people think about compensation, they think about cash. Yet your paycheck is only part of the picture. Many companies also offer noncash benefits such as healthcare, which can be worth up to 30% of each employee's pay. Researching, designing, and managing effective compensation systems are core HR functions.	the term compensation covers both pay and benefits , but when most people think about compensation , they think about cash . yet your paycheck is only part of the picture . many companies also offer noncash benefits such as healthcare , which can be worth up to 30 % of each employee 's pay . researching , designing , and managing effective compensation systems are core hr functions .
From a company perspective, compensation—both cash and noncash—represents a big chunk of product costs, especially in labor-intensive businesses such as banks, restaurants, and airlines.

Salaries, on the other hand, cover a fixed period, most often weekly or monthly. Most professional, administrative, and managerial jobs pay salaries. While salaries are usually higher than wages, salaried workers do not qualify for overtime, which means that sometimes a low-level manager's overall pay may be less than the pay of wagebased employees who work for that manager.	salaries , on the other hand , cover a fixed period , most often weekly or monthly . most professional , administrative , and managerial jobs pay salaries . while salaries are usually higher than wages , salaried workers do not qualify for overtime , which means that sometimes a low - level manager 's overall pay may be less than the pay of wagebased employees who work for that manager .

Benefits represent a significant chunk of money for employers, but for many years, workers took benefits for granted. No longer. As the unemployment rate skyrocketed in 2009, employees began to appreciate their benefits more than ever, recognizing that healthcare, dental care, paid sick days, retirement plans, and other perks add enormous value to their paychecks—and can be yanked at the discretion of their employer.20	benefits represent a significant chunk of money for employers , but for many years , workers took benefits for granted . no longer . as the unemployment rate skyrocketed in 2009 , employees began to appreciate their benefits more than ever , recognizing that healthcare , dental care , paid sick days , retirement plans , and other perks add enormous value to their paychecks — and can be yanked at the discretion of their employer.20

In 2017, International Business Machines (IBM) dismantled its extensive employee telecommuting program. The company gave thousands of remote employees a choice: relocate to a regional office—sometimes hundreds of miles from their homes—or leave the company. The policy change was a rude shock to many employees because IBM was an early adopter of telecommuting and an outspoken advocate of its effectiveness—once boasting that more than 40% of its employees worked outside of traditional company offices. IBM defended the decision as a strategy to improve collaboration and accelerate the pace of work. Rebuilding the design and digital marketing teams in-house, it said, would allow the company to respond quickly to real-time data and customer feedback.	in 2017 , international business machines ( ibm ) dismantled its extensive employee telecommuting program . the company gave thousands of remote employees a choice : relocate to a regional office — sometimes hundreds of miles from their homes — or leave the company . the policy change was a rude shock to many employees because ibm was an early adopter of telecommuting and an outspoken advocate of its effectiveness — once boasting that more than 40 % of its employees worked outside of traditional company offices . ibm defended the decision as a strategy to improve collaboration and accelerate the pace of work . rebuilding the design and digital marketing teams in - house , it said , would allow the company to respond quickly to real - time data and customer feedback .

Typically, companies with flextime scheduling oblige their employees to start work between mandated hours in the morning—say, anytime between 7 a.m. and 10 a.m.—to take lunch between certain hours in the middle of the day, and to complete work at the end of eight hours. This approach ensures that everyone is present during core hours for communication and coordination, but it provides choice outside those parameters. Flextime tends to increase employee morale and retention, but it makes less sense in jobs that entail extensive teamwork and customer interaction.

Booming technological advances make it possible for many employees to “commute” to the office via phones, fax machines, and broadband networks. More than 60% of companies allow telecommuting, and 20–30% of Americans telecommute at least occasionally. The bottom-line benefits for companies that embrace the approach can be significant. Over two-thirds of employers report increased productivity among their telecommuters. Telecommuting employees are 35–40% more productive than their office-bound colleagues. And direct savings from decreased costs add up fast, as well. By establishing telecommuting programs, employers can realize annual cost savings of $20,000–$37,000 per employee, which adds up to hundreds of millions of dollars each year for big players. In fact, if every worker who could telecommute did so just half the time, the economic benefit would total more than $700 billion a year. Businesses would increase national productivity by 5 million humanyears, or $270 billion worth of work. The nation would save almost 90,000 people from traffic-related injury or death.	booming technological advances make it possible for many employees to “ commute ” to the office via phones , fax machines , and broadband networks . more than 60 % of companies allow telecommuting , and 20–30 % of americans telecommute at least occasionally . the bottom - line benefits for companies that embrace the approach can be significant . over two - thirds of employers report increased productivity among their telecommuters . telecommuting employees are 35–40 % more productive than their office - bound colleagues . and direct savings from decreased costs add up fast , as well . by establishing telecommuting programs , employers can realize annual cost savings of $ 20,000–$37,000 per employee , which adds up to hundreds of millions of dollars each year for big players . in fact , if every worker who could telecommute did so just half the time , the economic benefit would total more than $ 700 billion a year . businesses would increase national productivity by 5 million humanyears , or $ 270 billion worth of work . the nation would save almost 90,000 people from traffic - related injury or death .

The term affirmative action refers to policies meant to increase employment and educational opportunities for minority groups—especially groups defined by race, ethnicity, or gender. Emerging during the American civil rights movement in the 1960s, affirmative action seeks to make up for the systematic discrimination of the past by creating more opportunities in the present.	the term affirmative action refers to policies meant to increase employment and educational opportunities for minority groups — especially groups defined by race , ethnicity , or gender . emerging during the american civil rights movement in the 1960s , affirmative action seeks to make up for the systematic discrimination of the past by creating more opportunities in the present .

Over the past few decades, computer and communications hardware and software have changed dramatically. The capabilities of hardware have increased by orders of magnitude. In the late 1950s, for example, you would have needed fifty 24-inch disks—costing tens of thousands of dollars—to store 5 megabytes of data. Today you can buy a flash memory device, about the same size as a postage stamp, that stores 128 gigabytes of data—over 24,000 times more than that whole 1950s disk array—for under	over the past few decades , computer and communications hardware and software have changed dramatically . the capabilities of hardware have increased by orders of magnitude . in the late 1950s , for example , you would have needed fifty 24 - inch disks — costing tens of thousands of dollars — to store 5 megabytes of data . today you can buy a flash memory device , about the same size as a postage stamp , that stores 128 gigabytes of data — over 24,000 times more than that whole 1950s disk array — for under

And in terms of processing power and performance, Apple's iPad Pro, which performs nearly 5 billion mathematical operations per second, is not only faster than multimillion dollar super computers from the 1990s, it runs 10 hours on its battery and can be controlled via dictation, easy-tolearn touch screen commands, or the Apple Pencil, which can be used for handwritten notes and creating incredibly detailed drawings.1 While more difficult to quantify with specific statistics, it's also clear that software has become more powerful, more flexible, and easier to use.	$ 30 . and in terms of processing power and performance , apple 's ipad pro , which performs nearly 5 billion mathematical operations per second , is not only faster than multimillion dollar super computers from the 1990s , it runs 10 hours on its battery and can be controlled via dictation , easy - tolearn touch screen commands , or the apple pencil , which can be used for handwritten notes and creating incredibly detailed drawings.1 while more difficult to quantify with specific statistics , it 's also clear that software has become more powerful , more flexible , and easier to use .

Perhaps an even more important development than the increased power of hardware and sophistication of ­software is the degree to which today's technology is linked by networks. These networks allow businesses to coordinate their internal functions, reach their customers, and collaborate with their suppliers and partners in ways that could not have been envisioned a quarter of a century ago. Networks have not only improved the efficiency and effectiveness of existing businesses, they've also opened up entirely new business opportunities. Pancreatic cancer often moves from stage I to stage IV in just a year. Because it grows so quickly and aggressively, it is often detected too late for surgical treatment. Just 25% of patients with untreatable pancreatic cancer survive after one year, and only 4% survive after five years.2 However, by examining search logs mentioning pancreatic cancer (“I was just diagnosed with pancreatic cancer”) on Microsoft's Bing.com search engine and then working backward to see if the same people had previously searched for information associated with symptoms of pancreatic cancer, researchers were able to identify 5% to 15% of people who later self-identified with the disease.

Early operating systems required users to type complex commands with very precise syntax to carry out tasks such as running programs or opening, saving, or deleting files. If you made an error while typing a command, your computer would just sit there until you typed the correct command. Today's operating systems are much simpler and more intuitive. The graphical user interface (or GUI— pronounced “gooey”) allows users to enter commands by clicking on icons on the computer screen or by tapping or swiping them on devices with a touch screen.	early operating systems required users to type complex commands with very precise syntax to carry out tasks such as running programs or opening , saving , or deleting files . if you made an error while typing a command , your computer would just sit there until you typed the correct command . today 's operating systems are much simpler and more intuitive . the graphical user interface ( or gui — pronounced “ gooey ” ) allows users to enter commands by clicking on icons on the computer screen or by tapping or swiping them on devices with a touch screen .

A network links computer resources, using either a wired or wireless connection. Firms usually want to prevent outsiders from obtaining access to their networks for privacy and security reasons, but they sometimes allow customers or suppliers partial access to their private networks to strengthen their relationships with these important stakeholders.	today , most firms ( and households ) use networks that allow users to communicate with each other and share both files and hardware resources . a network links computer resources , using either a wired or wireless connection . firms usually want to prevent outsiders from obtaining access to their networks for privacy and security reasons , but they sometimes allow customers or suppliers partial access to their private networks to strengthen their relationships with these important stakeholders .

Access to I2 was initially limited to dues-paying members of the Internet2 consortium, which today consists of over 317 major universities as well as 29 non-profit organizations, 83 leading high-tech corporations, 64 government agencies, 43 research and educational networks, and 65 international organizations.9 But under an initiative begun in 2001, members of the I2 consortium can sponsor access to the network for other research and educational organizations that otherwise would be unable to qualify for membership. This initiative has given many elementary schools, high schools, community colleges, libraries, and museums access to I2 resources.10	access to i2 was initially limited to dues - paying members of the internet2 consortium , which today consists of over 317 major universities as well as 29 non - profit organizations , 83 leading high - tech corporations , 64 government agencies , 43 research and educational networks , and 65 international organizations.9 but under an initiative begun in 2001 , members of the i2 consortium can sponsor access to the network for other research and educational organizations that otherwise would be unable to qualify for membership . this initiative has given many elementary schools , high schools , community colleges , libraries , and museums access to i2 resources.10

Member organizations see Internet2 as a way to bring together their researchers, scientists, and engineers at various locations in a way that allows real-time collaboration on complex and important topics. It also allows corporations to collaborate with other companies, universities, and organizations located thousands of miles apart. One of the missions of the Internet2 consortium is to “facilitate the development, deployment and use of revolutionary Internet technologies.”11 So, the benefits of Internet2 will eventually become commonplace on the Internet that the rest of us use.	i­nternet are n't even allowed . instead , it is a noncommercial network that uses high - speed connectivity to improve education , research , and collaboration . member organizations see internet2 as a way to bring together their researchers , scientists , and engineers at various locations in a way that allows real - time collaboration on complex and important topics . it also allows corporations to collaborate with other companies , universities , and organizations located thousands of miles apart . one of the missions of the internet2 consortium is to “ facilitate the development , deployment and use of revolutionary internet technologies . ”11 so , the benefits of internet2 will eventually become commonplace on the internet that the rest of us use .

Intranets and Extranets An intranet is a private network that has the same look and feel as the Web and uses the same web browser software to display documents, but limits access to the employees of a single firm (or members of a single organization). When properly implemented, intranets enhance communication and collaboration among employees and provide an effective way to distribute information and applications throughout the organization.	intranets and extranets an intranet is a private network that has the same look and feel as the web and uses the same web browser software to display documents , but limits access to the employees of a single firm ( or members of a single organization ) . when properly implemented , intranets enhance communication and collaboration among employees and provide an effective way to distribute information and applications throughout the organization .

One of the vital functions of information technology—at least in relationship to business—is to transform data into useful information for decision makers. In order to make decisions, managers must have information about the current state of their business, their competitive environment, and the trends and market conditions that offer new opportunities. Where does this information come from?	one of the vital functions of information technology — at least in relationship to business — is to transform data into useful information for decision makers . in order to make decisions , managers must have information about the current state of their business , their competitive environment , and the trends and market conditions that offer new opportunities . where does this information come from ?
Let's start by distinguishing between data and information. Data are the facts and figures a firm collects. Data in their raw form have limited usefulness because they lack the context needed to give them meaning. Data become information when they are processed, organized, and presented in a way that makes them useful to a decision maker. Sometimes firms can obtain useful information from external sources, but sometimes they must create information by processing their own data. Given today's competitive environment, the speed with which managers obtain good-quality information can be a crucial competitive advantage.	let 's start by distinguishing between data and information . data are the facts and figures a firm collects . data in their raw form have limited usefulness because they lack the context needed to give them meaning . data become information when they are processed , organized , and presented in a way that makes them useful to a decision maker . sometimes firms can obtain useful information from external sources , but sometimes they must create information by processing their own data . given today 's competitive environment , the speed with which managers obtain good - quality information can be a crucial competitive advantage .
Internally, every department of an organization generates facts and figures that the firm must store and track. Every time a financial transaction is completed, for example, the firm's accounting system must record the specific accounts affected. Similarly, a firm's human resources department must enter new data every time an employee is hired, fired, promoted, changes jobs, or retires. Firms must also keep track of the names, addresses, and credit information of each customer. This is hardly a complete list, but you get the picture; firms must store mountains of data and convert them into useful information.	internally , every department of an organization generates facts and figures that the firm must store and track . every time a financial transaction is completed , for example , the firm 's accounting system must record the specific accounts affected . similarly , a firm 's human resources department must enter new data every time an employee is hired , fired , promoted , changes jobs , or retires . firms must also keep track of the names , addresses , and credit information of each customer . this is hardly a complete list , but you get the picture ; firms must store mountains of data and convert them into useful information .
databases, which are files of related data organized according to a logical system and stored on hard drives or some other computer-accessible storage media. It isn't unusual for a company to have many different databases, each maintained by a different department or functional area to meet its specific needs. For example, the human resources department might have a database of employee pay rates, and the marketing department may have another database of customer history.	databases , which are files of related data organized according to a logical system and stored on hard drives or some other computer - accessible storage media . it is n't unusual for a company to have many different databases , each maintained by a different department or functional area to meet its specific needs . for example , the human resources department might have a database of employee pay rates , and the marketing department may have another database of customer history .
Once all these data are stored, the firm must convert them into information. One common method is to query a database. A query is a request for the database management software to search the database for data that match criteria specified by the user. Suppose, for instance, that a marketing manager plans to introduce a product upgrade.	once all these data are stored , the firm must convert them into information . one common method is to query a database . a query is a request for the database management software to search the database for data that match criteria specified by the user . suppose , for instance , that a marketing manager plans to introduce a product upgrade .

want to solve it. They just need access to the right data and a system to “crunch the numbers” in a way that provides relevant, accurate, and timely information to help them make their decisions. But what happens when the problem is beyond the expertise of the manager? One way to deal with this problem is to set up an expert system (ES) to guide the manager through the decision-making process.	want to solve it . they just need access to the right data and a system to “ crunch the numbers ” in a way that provides relevant , accurate , and timely information to help them make their decisions . but what happens when the problem is beyond the expertise of the manager ? one way to deal with this problem is to set up an expert system ( es ) to guide the manager through the decision - making process .
To develop expert systems, programmers ask experts in the relevant area to explain how they solve problems. They then devise a program to mimic the expert's approach, incorporating various rules or guidelines that the human expert uses. The finished program will ask a user a series of questions, basing each question on the response to the previous question. The program continues to ask questions until it has enough information to reach a decision and make a recommendation.	to develop expert systems , programmers ask experts in the relevant area to explain how they solve problems . they then devise a program to mimic the expert 's approach , incorporating various rules or guidelines that the human expert uses . the finished program will ask a user a series of questions , basing each question on the response to the previous question . the program continues to ask questions until it has enough information to reach a decision and make a recommendation .
Doctors at a large New York hospital system use an expert system to help determine if a coughing patient has pneumonia. The expert system asks the doctor whether the patient “has a fever and rapid heart rate,” and if the doctor hears, “a ‘crackle' in the lungs.”22 High scores indicate immediate treatment, while low scores suggest pneumonia isn't the issue.	doctors at a large new york hospital system use an expert system to help determine if a coughing patient has pneumonia . the expert system asks the doctor whether the patient “ has a fever and rapid heart rate , ” and if the doctor hears , “ a ‘ crackle ' in the lungs . ”22 high scores indicate immediate treatment , while low scores suggest pneumonia is n't the issue .
Expert systems routinely solve problems in areas as diverse as medical diagnoses, fraud detection, and consumer credit evaluation. The troubleshooting systems that many companies have on the customer-support pages of their websites are another type of expert system. If your product doesn't work, the troubleshooter will ask a series of questions designed to diagnose the problem and suggest solutions. Based on your responses to each question, the system selects the next question as it starts narrowing down the possible reasons for the problem until it identifies the cause and offers a solution. Often you can solve your problem without waiting on hold to talk to a human expert over the phone.23	expert systems routinely solve problems in areas as diverse as medical diagnoses , fraud detection , and consumer credit evaluation . the troubleshooting systems that many companies have on the customer - support pages of their websites are another type of expert system . if your product does n't work , the troubleshooter will ask a series of questions designed to diagnose the problem and suggest solutions . based on your responses to each question , the system selects the next question as it starts narrowing down the possible reasons for the problem until it identifies the cause and offers a solution . often you can solve your problem without waiting on hold to talk to a human expert over the phone.23
Despite impressive results in many fields, expert systems have their limitations. Programming thousands of decision rules into the system can be time-consuming, complicated, and expensive. In fact, it's sometimes impossible because the experts themselves can't clearly explain how they make their decisions—they just “know” the answer based on their years of experience. If the experts can't clearly explain how they reach their conclusions, then programmers can't include the appropriate decision rules in the system. Finally, an expert system has little flexibility and no common sense. It probably won't be able to find a solution to a problem that deviates in any significant way from the specific type of problem it was programmed to solve.24	despite impressive results in many fields , expert systems have their limitations . programming thousands of decision rules into the system can be time - consuming , complicated , and expensive . in fact , it 's sometimes impossible because the experts themselves ca n't clearly explain how they make their decisions — they just “ know ” the answer based on their years of experience . if the experts ca n't clearly explain how they reach their conclusions , then programmers ca n't include the appropriate decision rules in the system . finally , an expert system has little flexibility and no common sense . it probably wo n't be able to find a solution to a problem that deviates in any significant way from the specific type of problem it was programmed to solve.24

These websites presented information about products and allowed customers to place orders for goods and services, but offered little opportunity for user participation or involvement. However, by the early years of the twenty-first century, innovative businesses were developing ways to make e-commerce more interactive and collaborative. In doing so, they not only forged stronger relationships with the customers who posted this content, they also created a richer, more interesting, and more useful experience for others who visited the site.

Many Web 2.0 sites rely on users (or members) to provide most of their content. For instance, the online encyclopedia Wikipedia uses wiki software to allow users to comment on and contribute to its articles. And social networking sites such as Facebook and Twitter wouldn't exist without user-created material. The more users who participate on these sites, the more useful (and entertaining) they become—and the easier it is for them to attract even more visitors and contributors.	many web 2.0 sites rely on users ( or members ) to provide most of their content . for instance , the online encyclopedia wikipedia uses wiki software to allow users to comment on and contribute to its articles . and social networking sites such as facebook and twitter would n't exist without user - created material . the more users who participate on these sites , the more useful ( and entertaining ) they become — and the easier it is for them to attract even more visitors and contributors .

Advertising on the Internet Many B2C companies have large target markets, so advertising is an important part of their marketing strategy. Internet advertising revenue grew rapidly in the early twenty-first century, increasing almost fourfold from 2002 to 2008. It dropped slightly in early 2009 (as did most types of advertising expenditures during the onset of the recession) but began rising again later that year.	advertising on the internet many b2c companies have large target markets , so advertising is an important part of their marketing strategy . internet advertising revenue grew rapidly in the early twenty - first century , increasing almost fourfold from 2002 to 2008 . it dropped slightly in early 2009 ( as did most types of advertising expenditures during the onset of the recession ) but began rising again later that year .

Firms in B2C markets also use opt-in email as an advertising medium. Opt-in emails are messages that the receiver has explicitly chosen to receive. Customers often opt in when they register their products online and click to indicate that they would like to receive product information from the company. Since the customer has agreed to receive the message, opt-in emails tend to reach interested consumers. And, because email requires no envelopes, paper, or postage, it's much less expensive than direct mail.	firms in b2c markets also use opt - in email as an advertising medium . opt - in emails are messages that the receiver has explicitly chosen to receive . customers often opt in when they register their products online and click to indicate that they would like to receive product information from the company . since the customer has agreed to receive the message , opt - in emails tend to reach interested consumers . and , because email requires no envelopes , paper , or postage , it 's much less expensive than direct mail .

Tokenization, the use of one-time purchase codes, is an effective way to reduce online credit card fraud. Apple Pay, for example, uses secure fingerprint scanners on iPhones and iPads to authenticate your purchase approval. This is done on the device, not online, so it can't be hacked. Then, a one-time code or token is sent authorizing funds.

e-commerce normally requires customers to pay at the time the purchase is made. Clearly, the use of cash and paper checks isn't practical. In the United States, most payments in the B2C market are made by credit cards. To ensure that such transactions are secure, most sites transmit payment information using a secure socket layer (SSL) protocol. You can tell if a site on which you're doing business is using SSL in two fairly subtle ways. First, the URL will begin with https:// instead of simply http://.

So far, we've concentrated on the benefits of advances in information technology—and it's clear that these benefits are enormous. But rapid technological advances also pose challenges and create opportunities for abuse. These problems affect businesses, their customers, and their employees, as well as the general public.

Spam refers to unsolicited commercial emails, usually sent to huge numbers of people with little regard for whether they are interested in the product or not. It's estimated that 60% or more of all email traffic is spam. Some spam messages contain malicious email attachments that download ransomware to unknowing users' computers (see “Ransomware: Holding Your Data Hostage”).31 Spam filters are highly effective at screening the 205 billion emails sent every day. Google's Gmail, for instance, claims that that only 0.1% of spam gets past its spam filters to Gmail users. If all spam filters were that effective (they aren't), 205 million spam messages would still be delivered to email inboxes every day.	spam refers to unsolicited commercial emails , usually sent to huge numbers of people with little regard for whether they are interested in the product or not . it 's estimated that 60 % or more of all email traffic is spam . some spam messages contain malicious email attachments that download ransomware to unknowing users ' computers ( see “ ransomware : holding your data hostage”).31 spam filters are highly effective at screening the 205 billion emails sent every day . google 's gmail , for instance , claims that that only 0.1 % of spam gets past its spam filters to gmail users . if all spam filters were that effective ( they are n't ) , 205 million spam messages would still be delivered to email inboxes every day .

Phishing is another common use of spam. Phishers send email messages that appear to come from a legitimate business, such as a bank, credit card company, or retailer. The email attempts to get recipients to disclose personal information, such as their social security or credit card numbers, by claiming that there is a problem with their account—or sometimes simply that the account information needs to be verified or updated. The messages appear authentic; in addition to official-sounding language, they often include official-looking corporate logos. The email also usually provides a link to a website where the recipient is supposed to log in and enter the desired information. When the victims of the scam click on this link, they go to a website that can look amazingly like the site for the real company—but it's not. It's a clever spoof of the site where the phishers collect personal information and use it to steal identities. Exhibit 16.4 shows a highly sophisticated phishing attack using Google's Gmail service.

to trick people into divulging personal information. But pharming is more sophisticated and difficult to detect than phishing because it doesn't require the intended victim to click on a bogus email link. Instead, it uses techniques to redirect Internet traffic to the fake sites. Thus, even if you type in the correct URL for a website you want to visit, you still might find yourself on a very realistic-looking pharming site. One way to check the validity of the site is to look for the indications that the site is secure, such as the https:// in the URL and the small closed lock icon mentioned earlier.35	to trick people into divulging personal information . but pharming is more sophisticated and difficult to detect than phishing because it does n't require the intended victim to click on a bogus email link . instead , it uses techniques to redirect internet traffic to the fake sites . thus , even if you type in the correct url for a website you want to visit , you still might find yourself on a very realistic - looking pharming site . one way to check the validity of the site is to look for the indications that the site is secure , such as the https:// in the url and the small closed lock icon mentioned earlier.35

Protecting against hackers requires individuals and businesses to be security conscious. Some of the precautions used against hackers, such as making frequent backups, are similar to those used to protect against viruses. Another key to protecting against hackers is to make sure that all data transmitted over a network are encrypted, or sent in encoded form that can only be read by those who have access to a key. Security experts also suggest that organizations restrict access to computer resources by requiring users to have strong passwords. According to Microsoft, strong passwords are at least 14 characters in length; include a mix of letters, numbers, and special characters; and don't contain any common words or personal information.37 MIT researchers have found, however, that making passwords longer by “adding a word or two” is more effective than adding numbers or upper case letter. Their finding is that longer passwords are safer because they're much more difficult to crack.38	protecting against hackers requires individuals and businesses to be security conscious . some of the precautions used against hackers , such as making frequent backups , are similar to those used to protect against viruses . another key to protecting against hackers is to make sure that all data transmitted over a network are encrypted , or sent in encoded form that can only be read by those who have access to a key . security experts also suggest that organizations restrict access to computer resources by requiring users to have strong passwords . according to microsoft , strong passwords are at least 14 characters in length ; include a mix of letters , numbers , and special characters ; and do n't contain any common words or personal information.37 mit researchers have found , however , that making passwords longer by “ adding a word or two ” is more effective than adding numbers or upper case letter . their finding is that longer passwords are safer because they 're much more difficult to crack.38

Christoph von Hugo, says, “You could sacrifice the car, but then the people you've saved, you don't know what happens to them after that in situations that are often very complex, so you save the ones you know you can save.

Piracy of intellectual pro­perty occurs when someone reproduces and distributes copyrighted work without obtaining permission from—or providing compensation to—the owner of the copyrighted material. When piracy becomes widespread, creators of intellectual property receive much less income for their efforts. This can substantially reduce their incentive to continue developing creative material.	piracy of intellectual pro­perty occurs when someone reproduces and distributes copyrighted work without obtaining permission from — or providing compensation to — the owner of the copyrighted material . when piracy becomes widespread , creators of intellectual property receive much less income for their efforts . this can substantially reduce their incentive to continue developing creative material .

producing a product at the lowest cost. For example, passenger planes make money in the air, not sitting at the airport gate. So airlines strive to be as efficient as possible when “turning” planes. This means unloading the arriving passengers and luggage as quickly as possible, and then loading the departing passengers and luggage equally quickly. Ground crews must also hook the plane up to airport power and air conditioning, refuel the jet, and restock food and beverages before the plane can get back in the air. Turning planes efficiently is so critical to profitability that American Airlines awards each of its 113,000 employees a bonus of $150 if the company finishes among the top three airlines in key on-time rankings.1	producing a product at the lowest cost . for example , passenger planes make money in the air , not sitting at the airport gate . so airlines strive to be as efficient as possible when “ turning ” planes . this means unloading the arriving passengers and luggage as quickly as possible , and then loading the departing passengers and luggage equally quickly . ground crews must also hook the plane up to airport power and air conditioning , refuel the jet , and restock food and beverages before the plane can get back in the air . turning planes efficiently is so critical to profitability that american airlines awards each of its 113,000 employees a bonus of $ 150 if the company finishes among the top three airlines in key on - time rankings.1

In the 1960s, the focus of operations management was mainly on efficiency. The goal was to keep costs low so the firm could make a profit while keeping prices competitive. In today's highly competitive global markets, efficiency remains important. But operations managers now realize that keeping costs (and prices) low are only part of the equation. Customers usually buy goods that offer the best value—and these aren't always the same as the goods that sell for the lowest price. A product that offers better features, more attractive styling, and higher quality may provide more value—and attract more customers—than a product with a lower price. Thus, today's operations managers have broadened their focus to look at benefits as well as costs.	in the 1960s , the focus of operations management was mainly on efficiency . the goal was to keep costs low so the firm could make a profit while keeping prices competitive . in today 's highly competitive global markets , efficiency remains important . but operations managers now realize that keeping costs ( and prices ) low are only part of the equation . customers usually buy goods that offer the best value — and these are n't always the same as the goods that sell for the lowest price . a product that offers better features , more attractive styling , and higher quality may provide more value — and attract more customers — than a product with a lower price . thus , today 's operations managers have broadened their focus to look at benefits as well as costs .

From Goods to Services Goods are tangible products that you can see and touch. Durable goods are expected to last three years or longer; examples include furniture, cars, and appliances. Nondurable goods, such as toothpaste, apples, and paper towels, are used up more quickly and are often perishable. Services are activities that yield benefits but don't directly result in a physical product. Examples include legal advice, entertainment, and medical care. Goods are consumed, while services are experienced.	from goods to services goods are tangible products that you can see and touch . durable goods are expected to last three years or longer ; examples include furniture , cars , and appliances . nondurable goods , such as toothpaste , apples , and paper towels , are used up more quickly and are often perishable . services are activities that yield benefits but do n't directly result in a physical product . examples include legal advice , entertainment , and medical care . goods are consumed , while services are experienced .
In the 1960s, the U.S. economy was a manufacturing powerhouse, with more than a third of its labor force employed in the goods-producing sector. But over the last five decades, the American economy has experienced a fundamental shift away from the production of goods and toward the provision of services. By the beginning of 2017, less than 14% of the nonfarm labor force worked in the goods-producing sector.

For the first 25 years after World War II, American firms dominated key markets. This strength was based partly on the fact that the United States possessed a rich base of natural resources, a growing and increasingly well-educated labor force, an excellent infrastructure, and the strong incentive system inherent in a market economy. But it also reflected the fact that the production facilities and infrastructure in many European and Asian nations had been severely damaged during the war.	for the first 25 years after world war ii , american firms dominated key markets . this strength was based partly on the fact that the united states possessed a rich base of natural resources , a growing and increasingly well - educated labor force , an excellent infrastructure , and the strong incentive system inherent in a market economy . but it also reflected the fact that the production facilities and infrastructure in many european and asian nations had been severely damaged during the war .
By the early 1970s, the economies of Japan, Germany, and other war-ravaged nations had been rebuilt, with many of their major companies boasting efficient new production facilities with state-of-the-art technology.

Being the world's largest wood furniture producer gives Ikea leverage. When Ikea guarantees its 978 suppliers (in 50 countries) huge production contracts, they in turn give Ikea huge volume discounts on pricing. How much does Ikea produce? To give you some idea, 7,689,600 units of the best selling Billy book cases are produced each year, or roughly 15 per minute. With its huge production volumes, Ikea's costs are significantly lower than those of its competitors'.	being the world 's largest wood furniture producer gives ikea leverage . when ikea guarantees its 978 suppliers ( in 50 countries ) huge production contracts , they in turn give ikea huge volume discounts on pricing . how much does ikea produce ? to give you some idea , 7,689,600 units of the best selling billy book cases are produced each year , or roughly 15 per minute . with its huge production volumes , ikea 's costs are significantly lower than those of its competitors ' .
Vertical integration occurs when a firm develops the capability to carryout processes previously performed by its suppliers or distributors, or when it buys those external companies. Ikea uses 530 million cubic feet of wood each year—roughly 1% of the world's annual supply of lumber. To reduce costs and ensure access to sustainable wood, Ikea has begun vertically integrating its lumber supplies by buying forests in Romania, Bulgaria, Estonia, Lithuania, and Latvia.	vertical integration occurs when a firm develops the capability to carryout processes previously performed by its suppliers or distributors , or when it buys those external companies . ikea uses 530 million cubic feet of wood each year — roughly 1 % of the world 's annual supply of lumber . to reduce costs and ensure access to sustainable wood , ikea has begun vertically integrating its lumber supplies by buying forests in romania , bulgaria , estonia , lithuania , and latvia .
A significant part of operations management is designing products that meet customers' needs. While Ikea has always designed products for tight living spaces (such as fold-up tables, sofas, and beds), it is now having to redesign many of its products to accommodate modern apartment spaces, which have shrunk worldwide by 20% since 2001. Ikea tests new product ideas in a 600 square foot, 2-room apartment in Sweden. After living in the test apartment for 2 weeks with his three sons, Swede Robin Williams said, “The apartment felt much bigger than mine, which is actually 20 square meters bigger.”	a significant part of operations management is designing products that meet customers ' needs . while ikea has always designed products for tight living spaces ( such as fold - up tables , sofas , and beds ) , it is now having to redesign many of its products to accommodate modern apartment spaces , which have shrunk worldwide by 20 % since 2001 . ikea tests new product ideas in a 600 square foot , 2 - room apartment in sweden . after living in the test apartment for 2 weeks with his three sons , swede robin williams said , “ the apartment felt much bigger than mine , which is actually 20 square meters bigger . ”

From Exploiting the Environment to Protecting the Environment In the 1960s, many operations managers viewed the natural environment as something to exploit. The emphasis on keeping costs low made it tempting to dispose of wastes as cheaply as possible— often by dumping them into rivers, lakes, or the atmosphere.	from exploiting the environment to protecting the environment in the 1960s , many operations managers viewed the natural environment as something to exploit . the emphasis on keeping costs low made it tempting to dispose of wastes as cheaply as possible — often by dumping them into rivers , lakes , or the atmosphere .

Once the actual goods and services are designed, operations managers must determine the processes needed to produce them and get them to the customer. A process is a set of related activities that transform inputs into outputs, thus adding value. Once these processes are designed, operations managers also play a key role in determining where they will be performed, what organizations will perform them, and how the processes will be organized and coordinated.	once the actual goods and services are designed , operations managers must determine the processes needed to produce them and get them to the customer . a process is a set of related activities that transform inputs into outputs , thus adding value . once these processes are designed , operations managers also play a key role in determining where they will be performed , what organizations will perform them , and how the processes will be organized and coordinated .
The most obvious processes are those directly involved in the production of goods and services. But there are many other processes that play necessary “supporting roles.” For example, purchasing and inventory management processes ensure that the firm has an adequate supply of high-quality materials, parts, and components needed to produce the goods without delays or disruptions.	the most obvious processes are those directly involved in the production of goods and services . but there are many other processes that play necessary “ supporting roles . ” for example , purchasing and inventory management processes ensure that the firm has an adequate supply of high - quality materials , parts , and components needed to produce the goods without delays or disruptions .

For example, in a machine shop, all of the drills may be located in one area, all of the lathes in another area, and all of the grinders in yet another. Unlike ass­ embly lines and other product layouts, a process layout doesn't require work to be performed in a specific sequence; instead, the product can be moved from one type of machinery to another in whatever sequence is necessary. Thus, process layouts can be used to produce a variety of products without the need for expensive retooling. But this flexibility sometimes comes at the cost of longer processing times and more complex planning and control systems. Also, because the machinery and equipment used in a process layout is usually more generalpurpose in nature and may be used to produce a greater variety of goods, the process layout requires workers to be more versatile than those employed in a product layout.	for example , in a machine shop , all of the drills may be located in one area , all of the lathes in another area , and all of the grinders in yet another . unlike ass­ embly lines and other product layouts , a process layout does n't require work to be performed in a specific sequence ; instead , the product can be moved from one type of machinery to another in whatever sequence is necessary . thus , process layouts can be used to produce a variety of products without the need for expensive retooling . but this flexibility sometimes comes at the cost of longer processing times and more complex planning and control systems . also , because the machinery and equipment used in a process layout is usually more generalpurpose in nature and may be used to produce a greater variety of goods , the process layout requires workers to be more versatile than those employed in a product layout .
A cellular layout falls between the product layout and the process layout. It groups different types of machinery and equipment into self-contained cells. A production facility might have several cells, each designed to efficiently produce a family of parts (or entire products) that have similar processing requirements. Like an assembly line, the product moves from one station in the cell to the next in a specific sequence. However, unlike most assembly lines, cells are relatively small and are designed to be operated by a few workers who perform a wider array of tasks than assemblyline workers.	a cellular layout falls between the product layout and the process layout . it groups different types of machinery and equipment into self - contained cells . a production facility might have several cells , each designed to efficiently produce a family of parts ( or entire products ) that have similar processing requirements . like an assembly line , the product moves from one station in the cell to the next in a specific sequence . however , unlike most assembly lines , cells are relatively small and are designed to be operated by a few workers who perform a wider array of tasks than assemblyline workers .

Firms often use a product layout when they produce goods that are relatively standardized and produced in large volumes. This type of layout organizes machinery, equipment, and other resources according to the specific sequence of operations that must be performed. The machinery used in this type of layout is often highly specialized, designed to perform one specific task very efficiently.

Inventories are stocks of goods or other items held by an organization. Manufacturing firms usually hold inventories of raw materials, components and parts, work in process, and finished goods. Retail firms don't normally hold work in process or raw materials, but they do hold inventories of the finished goods they sell as well as basic supplies that they need.	inventories are stocks of goods or other items held by an organization . manufacturing firms usually hold inventories of raw materials , components and parts , work in process , and finished goods . retail firms do n't normally hold work in process or raw materials , but they do hold inventories of the finished goods they sell as well as basic supplies that they need .

To minimize stock-outs, Home Depot is changing supplier delivery schedules. For example, it might move from five truck deliveries two-days-a-week to two truck deliveries five-days-a-week. Finally, with less in-store inventory, store employees can quickly put new shipments directly onto lower store shelves instead of the slower, more expensive process of putting excess product inventory on top shelves via ladders and forklifts.11	to minimize stock - outs , home depot is changing supplier delivery schedules . for example , it might move from five truck deliveries two - days - a - week to two truck deliveries five - days - a - week . finally , with less in - store inventory , store employees can quickly put new shipments directly onto lower store shelves instead of the slower , more expensive process of putting excess product inventory on top shelves via ladders and forklifts.11

For example, it is clear that the cast for the play cannot be determined until the play has been selected, so activity A (selecting the play) is an immediate predecessor to activity B (selecting the cast).	notice that exhibit 17.3 identifies immediate predecessors for all of the activities except activity a. immediate predecessors are activities that must be completed before another activity can begin . for example , it is clear that the cast for the play can not be determined until the play has been selected , so activity a ( selecting the play ) is an immediate predecessor to activity b ( selecting the cast ) .

We can use Exhibit 17.4 to illustrate some basic concepts used in CPM analysis. A path is a sequence of activities that must be completed in the order specified by the arrows for the overall project to be completed. You can trace several paths in our example by following a series of arrows from start to finish. For example, one path is A → B →	we can use exhibit 17.4 to illustrate some basic concepts used in cpm analysis . a path is a sequence of activities that must be completed in the order specified by the arrows for the overall project to be completed . you can trace several paths in our example by following a series of arrows from start to finish . for example , one path is a → b →
The critical path consists of the sequence of activities that takes the longest to complete. A delay in any activity on a critical path is likely to delay the completion of the entire project. Thus, operations managers watch activities on the critical path very carefully and take actions to help ensure that they remain on schedule. We've shown the critical path for the theater project (A → D → F → H →	the critical path consists of the sequence of activities that takes the longest to complete . a delay in any activity on a critical path is likely to delay the completion of the entire project . thus , operations managers watch activities on the critical path very carefully and take actions to help ensure that they remain on schedule . we 've shown the critical path for the theater project ( a → d → f → h →
Distinguishing between the critical path and other paths can help operations managers allocate resources more efficiently. Activities that aren't on the critical path can be delayed without causing a delay in the overall completion of the project—as long as the delay isn't too great. In CPM terminology, these activities have slack. When operations managers see delays in critical path activities, they may be able to keep the project on track by diverting manpower and other resources from activities with slack to activities on the critical path.	distinguishing between the critical path and other paths can help operations managers allocate resources more efficiently . activities that are n't on the critical path can be delayed without causing a delay in the overall completion of the project — as long as the delay is n't too great . in cpm terminology , these activities have slack . when operations managers see delays in critical path activities , they may be able to keep the project on track by diverting manpower and other resources from activities with slack to activities on the critical path .

Perhaps the most important function of operations management is the design and management of value chains. A value chain is the network of relationships that channels the flow of inputs, information, and financial resources through all of the processes directly or indirectly involved in producing goods and services and distributing them to customers.	perhaps the most important function of operations management is the design and management of value chains . a value chain is the network of relationships that channels the flow of inputs , information , and financial resources through all of the processes directly or indirectly involved in producing goods and services and distributing them to customers .
An organization's value chain clearly includes its supply chain, which consists of the organizations, activities, and processes involved in the physical flow of goods, from the raw materials stage to the final consumer. In fact, some organizations use the terms value chain and supply chain interchangeably. But a value chain is a broader concept; in addition to the supply chain, it includes activities and processes involved in acquiring customers—such as contract negotiations and customer financing—as well as activities and processes involved in keeping customers by providing services after the sale, such as performing warranty repairs, offering call center assistance, and helping customers recycle used goods. In a value chain, the main focus is on the customer; in contrast, the supply chain is more oriented toward traditional production relationships.12	an organization 's value chain clearly includes its supply chain , which consists of the organizations , activities , and processes involved in the physical flow of goods , from the raw materials stage to the final consumer . in fact , some organizations use the terms value chain and supply chain interchangeably . but a value chain is a broader concept ; in addition to the supply chain , it includes activities and processes involved in acquiring customers — such as contract negotiations and customer financing — as well as activities and processes involved in keeping customers by providing services after the sale , such as performing warranty repairs , offering call center assistance , and helping customers recycle used goods . in a value chain , the main focus is on the customer ; in contrast , the supply chain is more oriented toward traditional production relationships.12
One of the most important issues that operations managers examine when they design value chains is the tradeoff between vertical integration and outsourcing. Vertical integration occurs when a firm attempts to gain more control over its value chain by either developing the ability to perform processes previously performed by other organizations in the chain or by acquiring those organizations.	one of the most important issues that operations managers examine when they design value chains is the tradeoff between vertical integration and outsourcing . vertical integration occurs when a firm attempts to gain more control over its value chain by either developing the ability to perform processes previously performed by other organizations in the chain or by acquiring those organizations .

Even when a firm decides to perform processes itself, it still faces a choice: Should it perform these functions domestically, or should it offshore these activities? Offshoring means moving processes previously performed domestically to a foreign location. It is important to realize that offshoring is not the same thing as outsourcing processes to other organizations. Offshoring doesn't require outsourcing; a firm often offshores processes by directly investing in its own foreign facilities. Similarly, outsourcing doesn't require a firm to go offshore; activities can be outsourced to other domestic firms. Despite this distinction, many firms have combined these approaches by hiring organizations in other countries to perform some of the value chain The network processes that they previof relationships that channels ously performed at their the flow of inputs, information, own domestic facilities. and financial resources through all of the processes directly or	even when a firm decides to perform processes itself , it still faces a choice : should it perform these functions domestically , or should it offshore these activities ? offshoring means moving processes previously performed domestically to a foreign location . it is important to realize that offshoring is not the same thing as outsourcing processes to other organizations . offshoring does n't require outsourcing ; a firm often offshores processes by directly investing in its own foreign facilities . similarly , outsourcing does n't require a firm to go offshore ; activities can be outsourced to other domestic firms . despite this distinction , many firms have combined these approaches by hiring organizations in other countries to perform some of the value chain the network processes that they previof relationships that channels ously performed at their the flow of inputs , information , own domestic facilities . and financial resources through all of the processes directly or

Exhibit 17.5 illustrates how services differ from tangible goods. These differences present a number of challenges to service providers. One key challenge arises because customers often participate in the provision of services, which means that service providers have less control over how the process is carried out, how long it takes to complete, and whether the result is satisfactory. For instance, the accuracy of a doctor's diagnosis depends on how honestly and completely the patient answers the doctor's questions.	exhibit 17.5 illustrates how services differ from tangible goods . these differences present a number of challenges to service providers . one key challenge arises because customers often participate in the provision of services , which means that service providers have less control over how the process is carried out , how long it takes to complete , and whether the result is satisfactory . for instance , the accuracy of a doctor 's diagnosis depends on how honestly and completely the patient answers the doctor 's questions .

Because services are intangible and often must be experienced at the time they are created, service providers can't produce the service in advance and store it to meet temporary surges in demand. This can create challenges for operations managers because the demand for many types of services varies significantly, depending on the season, the day of the week, or the time of day. During peak lunch and dinner hours, popular restaurants tend to be very busy—often with crowds waiting to get a table. The same restaurants may be nearly empty during the mid-afternoon or late at night. Given such fluctuations in demand, the selection of capacity—the number of customers the service facility can accommodate per time period—becomes a crucial consideration.	because services are intangible and often must be experienced at the time they are created , service providers ca n't produce the service in advance and store it to meet temporary surges in demand . this can create challenges for operations managers because the demand for many types of services varies significantly , depending on the season , the day of the week , or the time of day . during peak lunch and dinner hours , popular restaurants tend to be very busy — often with crowds waiting to get a table . the same restaurants may be nearly empty during the mid - afternoon or late at night . given such fluctuations in demand , the selection of capacity — the number of customers the service facility can accommodate per time period — becomes a crucial consideration .
If the capacity of a service facility is too small, customers facing long waits during periods of peak demand may well take their business elsewhere. But a facility large enough to handle peak capacity is more expensive to build; costs more to heat, cool, and insure; and may have substantial excess capacity during off-peak periods. Operations managers must weigh these drawbacks against the ability to handle a larger number of customers during peak hours.	if the capacity of a service facility is too small , customers facing long waits during periods of peak demand may well take their business elsewhere . but a facility large enough to handle peak capacity is more expensive to build ; costs more to heat , cool , and insure ; and may have substantial excess capacity during off - peak periods . operations managers must weigh these drawbacks against the ability to handle a larger number of customers during peak hours .
Many service firms try to minimize this trade-off by finding ways to spread out demand so that big surges don't occur. One way to do this is to give customers an incentive to use the service at off-peak times. Many bars and restaurants have “happy hours” or “early-bird specials.” Similarly, movie theaters have lower prices for matinée showings, and resort hotels offer reduced rates during their off seasons.	many service firms try to minimize this trade - off by finding ways to spread out demand so that big surges do n't occur . one way to do this is to give customers an incentive to use the service at off - peak times . many bars and restaurants have “ happy hours ” or “ early - bird specials . ” similarly , movie theaters have lower prices for matinée showings , and resort hotels offer reduced rates during their off seasons .

Automation began in the early 1950s with primitive programmed machines. But in recent decades, robots have taken automation to a whole new level. Robots are reprogrammable machines that can manipulate materials, tools, parts, and specialized devices in order to perform a variety of tasks. Some robots have special sensors that allow them to “see,” “hear,” or “feel” their environment. Many robots are mobile and can even be guided over rugged terrain.	automation began in the early 1950s with primitive programmed machines . but in recent decades , robots have taken automation to a whole new level . robots are reprogrammable machines that can manipulate materials , tools , parts , and specialized devices in order to perform a variety of tasks . some robots have special sensors that allow them to “ see , ” “ hear , ” or “ feel ” their environment . many robots are mobile and can even be guided over rugged terrain .

When a CAD/CAM software system is integrated with robots and other high-tech equipment, the result is computer-integrated manufacturing (CIM), in which the whole design and production process is highly automated. The speed of computers, the ability to reprogram computers rapidly, and the integration of all these functions make it possible to switch from the design and production of one good to another quickly and efficiently. CIM allows firms to produce custom-designed products for individual customers quickly and at costs almost as low as those associated with mass-production techniques, thus allowing firms to pursue the strategy of mass customization mentioned at the beginning of this chapter.	when a cad / cam software system is integrated with robots and other high - tech equipment , the result is computer - integrated manufacturing ( cim ) , in which the whole design and production process is highly automated . the speed of computers , the ability to reprogram computers rapidly , and the integration of all these functions make it possible to switch from the design and production of one good to another quickly and efficiently . cim allows firms to produce custom - designed products for individual customers quickly and at costs almost as low as those associated with mass - production techniques , thus allowing firms to pursue the strategy of mass customization mentioned at the beginning of this chapter .

And the costs of poor quality can be even higher when a firm doesn't catch defects before shipping products to consumers. These costs include handling customer complaints, warranty repair work, loss of goodwill, and the possibility of bad publicity or lawsuits. In the long run, firms often find that improving quality reduces these costs by more than enough to make up for their investment.	and the costs of poor quality can be even higher when a firm does n't catch defects before shipping products to consumers . these costs include handling customer complaints , warranty repair work , loss of goodwill , and the possibility of bad publicity or lawsuits . in the long run , firms often find that improving quality reduces these costs by more than enough to make up for their investment .
These ideas aren't especially new. W. Edwards Deming, viewed by many as the father of the quality movement, first proposed the relationship between quality and business success in the early 1950s.

In the years immediately after World War II, most Japanese goods had a reputation for being cheap and shoddy. But during the 1950s, many Japanese firms sought advice from Deming and other U.S. quality gurus. They learned to view quality improvement as a continuous process that was the responsibility of all employees in the organization. During the 1950s and 1960s, the quality of Japanese goods slowly but steadily improved.	in the years immediately after world war ii , most japanese goods had a reputation for being cheap and shoddy . but during the 1950s , many japanese firms sought advice from deming and other u.s. quality gurus . they learned to view quality improvement as a continuous process that was the responsibility of all employees in the organization . during the 1950s and 1960s , the quality of japanese goods slowly but steadily improved .

A team of 50 UPS engineers wrote the 1,000-page algorithm that searches for the best possible way for drivers to organize their routes and calculates the most efficient path between a variety of points. Every time a change to a driver's route is needed, ORION considers up to 200,000 options before indicating the best scheduling alternative.

Most of the standards established by the ISO are industry-specific. But in 1987, the ISO developed and published the ISO 9000 family of standards. The goal of this effort was to articulate an international consensus on good quality-management practices that could be applied to virtually any company. Similar to the other quality initiatives we've discussed, ISO 9000 standards define quality in terms of the ability to satisfy customer preferences and require the firm to implement procedures for continuous quality improvement.	most of the standards established by the iso are industry - specific . but in 1987 , the iso developed and published the iso 9000 family of standards . the goal of this effort was to articulate an international consensus on good quality - management practices that could be applied to virtually any company . similar to the other quality initiatives we 've discussed , iso 9000 standards define quality in terms of the ability to satisfy customer preferences and require the firm to implement procedures for continuous quality improvement .

Lean production refers to a set of strategies and practices to eliminate waste, which is defined as any function or activity that uses resources but doesn't create value. Eliminating waste can lead to dramatic improvements in efficiency. For example, Louis Vuitton produces some of the most expensive handmade bags and purses in the world. To increase productivity, it switched to teams of 6 to 12 workers who learned to complete multiple production steps.

One of the hallmarks of lean systems is a tight control on inventories. In part, this reflects recognition of the costs of holding large inventories that we discussed earlier. But the lean approach also offers another reason for minimizing inventories. Large inventories serve as a buffer that enables a firm to continue operations when problems arise due to poor quality, faulty equipment, or unreliable suppliers—making it easier for firms to live with these problems rather than correct them. Advocates of lean production argue that, in the long run, it is more efficient to improve quality, keep equipment in good working order, and develop reliable supply relationships than to continue compensating for these lean production problems by holding large inventories.	one of the hallmarks of lean systems is a tight control on inventories . in part , this reflects recognition of the costs of holding large inventories that we discussed earlier . but the lean approach also offers another reason for minimizing inventories . large inventories serve as a buffer that enables a firm to continue operations when problems arise due to poor quality , faulty equipment , or unreliable suppliers — making it easier for firms to live with these problems rather than correct them . advocates of lean production argue that , in the long run , it is more efficient to improve quality , keep equipment in good working order , and develop reliable supply relationships than to continue compensating for these lean production problems by holding large inventories .

finished goods by using just-in-time (JIT) production methods. JIT produces only enough goods to satisfy current demand. This approach is called a pull system because actual orders “pull” the goods through the production process. The workers at the end of the production process produce just enough of the final product to satisfy actual orders and use just enough parts and materials from preceding stages of production to satisfy their needs. Workers at each earlier stage are expected to produce just enough output at their workstations to replace the amount used by the processes further along in the process—and in so doing they withdraw just the needed amount of parts and other supplies from even earlier processes.	finished goods by using just - in - time ( jit ) production methods . jit produces only enough goods to satisfy current demand . this approach is called a pull system because actual orders “ pull ” the goods through the production process . the workers at the end of the production process produce just enough of the final product to satisfy actual orders and use just enough parts and materials from preceding stages of production to satisfy their needs . workers at each earlier stage are expected to produce just enough output at their workstations to replace the amount used by the processes further along in the process — and in so doing they withdraw just the needed amount of parts and other supplies from even earlier processes .
JIT techniques obviously result in very small inventories of finished goods and work in process. But lean firms also hold only small inventories of materials and parts, counting on suppliers to provide them with these items as they need them to meet current demand. In a lean system, all organizations in the supply chain use the JIT approach, so that inventories are minimized at each stage. Clearly, this type of system requires incredible coordination among all parts of the supply chain; in fact, the movement toward JIT is a key reason why supply chain management has become so crucial. Spainbased Zara is a global clothing and accessories retailer.	jit techniques obviously result in very small inventories of finished goods and work in process . but lean firms also hold only small inventories of materials and parts , counting on suppliers to provide them with these items as they need them to meet current demand . in a lean system , all organizations in the supply chain use the jit approach , so that inventories are minimized at each stage . clearly , this type of system requires incredible coordination among all parts of the supply chain ; in fact , the movement toward jit is a key reason why supply chain management has become so crucial . spainbased zara is a global clothing and accessories retailer .

Come From? A budget starts with a forecast of your income—the money you bring in. This can come from many different sources. For many people, the paycheck from their job is their primary source of income. But the major source of income for entrepreneurs may be the profits they earn from their businesses. Some people also derive a substantial amount of income from financial investments, such as stocks and bonds, while others earn rental income. Retirees often depend on pensions, Social Security, and private investments for much of their income.	come from ? a budget starts with a forecast of your income — the money you bring in . this can come from many different sources . for many people , the paycheck from their job is their primary source of income . but the major source of income for entrepreneurs may be the profits they earn from their businesses . some people also derive a substantial amount of income from financial investments , such as stocks and bonds , while others earn rental income . retirees often depend on pensions , social security , and private investments for much of their income .
Once you have identified the amount of income you expect to receive from various sources, you can turn your focus to the spending side of your budget. To set up your budget, you'll need to be very specific about where your money goes. As we've already mentioned, carefully tracking your expenditures over a period of several months can help you identify your spending patterns. Many people who do this are surprised by the habits they uncover. You may find that you're spending a lot more than you thought on video games, music downloads, or clothes. Once you discover your spending patterns, you'll be in a better position to determine the categories of spending to include in your budget and to estimate the amount you'll spend in each category.	once you have identified the amount of income you expect to receive from various sources , you can turn your focus to the spending side of your budget . to set up your budget , you 'll need to be very specific about where your money goes . as we 've already mentioned , carefully tracking your expenditures over a period of several months can help you identify your spending patterns . many people who do this are surprised by the habits they uncover . you may find that you 're spending a lot more than you thought on video games , music downloads , or clothes . once you discover your spending patterns , you 'll be in a better position to determine the categories of spending to include in your budget and to estimate the amount you 'll spend in each category .

A savings account is an interest-earning account that is intended to satisfy obligations that your checking account cannot handle. Think of your savings account as a “safety net” for unexpected financial challenges, such as a major plumbing repair, the need to replace your car's transmission, or even the loss of your job. Many financial experts suggest that you have enough money in your savings to cover six months of your expenses. The good news is that if you're lucky enough to avoid major problems, your savings account will earn you a bit of interest income.	a savings account is an interest - earning account that is intended to satisfy obligations that your checking account can not handle . think of your savings account as a “ safety net ” for unexpected financial challenges , such as a major plumbing repair , the need to replace your car 's transmission , or even the loss of your job . many financial experts suggest that you have enough money in your savings to cover six months of your expenses . the good news is that if you 're lucky enough to avoid major problems , your savings account will earn you a bit of interest income .

Credit refers to your ability to obtain goods or resources without having to make immediate payment. One of the most important determinants of the amount of credit you can obtain is your credit score, which is a numerical indicator of your creditworthiness. Currently, the most commonly used credit scoring system is the Fair, Isaac and Company (FICO) scale. The FICO scale runs from 300 to 850.	credit refers to your ability to obtain goods or resources without having to make immediate payment . one of the most important determinants of the amount of credit you can obtain is your credit score , which is a numerical indicator of your creditworthiness . currently , the most commonly used credit scoring system is the fair , isaac and company ( fico ) scale . the fico scale runs from 300 to 850 .

Although many young adults manage their credit cards without major problems, others are stunned when the credit card bill arrives. Many never read their credit card agreements, so they are taken by surprise by higher than expected interest charges and fees. Others simply lack discipline. They succumb to the temptations of a “buy now, pay later” mentality and run up big bills that they can't afford to pay.	although many young adults manage their credit cards without major problems , others are stunned when the credit card bill arrives . many never read their credit card agreements , so they are taken by surprise by higher than expected interest charges and fees . others simply lack discipline . they succumb to the temptations of a “ buy now , pay later ” mentality and run up big bills that they ca n't afford to pay .

Make sure you don't use the card again until you've gotten your spending habits under control.

Once you've eliminated the temptation to dig a deeper hole, the next step is to make sure you consistently pay a substantial amount each month toward retiring the debt on that card. Given how high APRs are on the unpaid balances for most credit cards, it is usually a good idea to place a very high priority on eliminating these balances as quickly as possible.	once you 've eliminated the temptation to dig a deeper hole , the next step is to make sure you consistently pay a substantial amount each month toward retiring the debt on that card . given how high aprs are on the unpaid balances for most credit cards , it is usually a good idea to place a very high priority on eliminating these balances as quickly as possible .
If you just can't seem to shake the habit of overspending, consider using cash or a debit card instead of a credit card. Although a debit card looks like a credit card, there is a big difference. When you use a debit card, money is immediately withdrawn from your bank account, so you “feel the pain” just as if you'd paid in cash. Many people spend less when they use cash or debit cards than when they use credit cards.	if you just ca n't seem to shake the habit of overspending , consider using cash or a debit card instead of a credit card . although a debit card looks like a credit card , there is a big difference . when you use a debit card , money is immediately withdrawn from your bank account , so you “ feel the pain ” just as if you 'd paid in cash . many people spend less when they use cash or debit cards than when they use credit cards .
Two recent laws have had a significant impact on credit card practices. The Credit Card Accountability, Responsibility and Disclosure Act of 2009 (often called the CARD Act) requires issuers to give a 45-day notice before making significant changes to credit agreements and prohibits them from raising interest rates on existing balances unless the borrower is more than 60 days late in making required payments. It also requires anyone under the age of 21 who applies for a credit card to either verify proof of income or have an adult cosign the application. And it places caps on certain types of fees that credit card issuers can charge.15	two recent laws have had a significant impact on credit card practices . the credit card accountability , responsibility and disclosure act of 2009 ( often called the card act ) requires issuers to give a 45 - day notice before making significant changes to credit agreements and prohibits them from raising interest rates on existing balances unless the borrower is more than 60 days late in making required payments . it also requires anyone under the age of 21 who applies for a credit card to either verify proof of income or have an adult cosign the application . and it places caps on certain types of fees that credit card issuers can charge.15

Options? Now that we've demonstrated the importance of investing, let's look at some specific types of financial instruments you might want to include in your investment portfolio. Our brief discussion can't hope to cover all of the possibilities, so we'll focus only on some of the most common choices. Keep in mind that, in addition to the financial instruments we describe in this section, many people also hold much of their wealth in other assets. The largest single asset for many households is the equity they have in their home.	options ? now that we 've demonstrated the importance of investing , let 's look at some specific types of financial instruments you might want to include in your investment portfolio . our brief discussion ca n't hope to cover all of the possibilities , so we 'll focus only on some of the most common choices . keep in mind that , in addition to the financial instruments we describe in this section , many people also hold much of their wealth in other assets . the largest single asset for many households is the equity they have in their home .
Let's begin by looking at common stock, which represents ownership in a corporation. Common stock offers the possibility of two types of financial returns. The first, called a dividend, is a distribution of ­profits paid out to the stockholders. Dividends are paid only if the corporation's board of directors declares them—and there is no legal requirement for them to do so. If a corporation is in poor financial shape, its board of directors may decide that it is unable to pay a dividend. But even if a company is highly profitable, its board may decide to reinvest (retain) its profits rather than pay dividends to stockholders.	let 's begin by looking at common stock , which represents ownership in a corporation . common stock offers the possibility of two types of financial returns . the first , called a dividend , is a distribution of ­profits paid out to the stockholders . dividends are paid only if the corporation 's board of directors declares them — and there is no legal requirement for them to do so . if a corporation is in poor financial shape , its board of directors may decide that it is unable to pay a dividend . but even if a company is highly profitable , its board may decide to reinvest ( retain ) its profits rather than pay dividends to stockholders .

The rate of interest paid on CDs is often higher than the rate on a regular savings account but usually lower than the interest rate on corporate bonds and most government securities. CDs with longer maturities typically earn a higher interest rate than CDs that have shorter terms. You can cash in a CD before it matures, but you'll incur a substantial penalty if you do.	the rate of interest paid on cds is often higher than the rate on a regular savings account but usually lower than the interest rate on corporate bonds and most government securities . cds with longer maturities typically earn a higher interest rate than cds that have shorter terms . you can cash in a cd before it matures , but you 'll incur a substantial penalty if you do .

Investors can earn a second type of return, called a capital gain, if the market price of their stock rises relative to the price they paid for it. But stock prices can go down as well as up—as many investors have painfully discovered in recent years! Thus, it is possible for investors to experience capital losses as well as capital gains. For example, while the average compound return from S&P 500 stocks was 9.83% a year from January 1988 to February 2017, the	investors can earn a second type of return , called a capital gain , if the market price of their stock rises relative to the price they paid for it . but stock prices can go down as well as up — as many investors have painfully discovered in recent years ! thus , it is possible for investors to experience capital losses as well as capital gains . for example , while the average compound return from s&p 500 stocks was 9.83 % a year from january 1988 to february 2017 , the

In addition to common stock, some corporations also offer another type of stock, called preferred stock. The two types of stock have some important differences. From the perspective of many investors, the most i­mportant distinction is that owners of preferred stock are more likely to receive a dividend than owners of common stock. Preferred stock is normally issued with a stated dividend, and common stockholders can't be paid any dividend until the preferred dividend is paid in full. Still, even preferred stockholders have no guaranteed legal right to receive a dividend.	in addition to common stock , some corporations also offer another type of stock , called preferred stock . the two types of stock have some important differences . from the perspective of many investors , the most i­mportant distinction is that owners of preferred stock are more likely to receive a dividend than owners of common stock . preferred stock is normally issued with a stated dividend , and common stockholders ca n't be paid any dividend until the preferred dividend is paid in full . still , even preferred stockholders have no guaranteed legal right to receive a dividend .
A corporate bond is another type of corporate security, but it is quite different from stock. A bond is a formal IOU issued by a corporation. While stockholders are the owners of a corporation, bondholders are its creditors. Most bonds are long-term debts that mature (come due) 10 to 30 years after they are issued, though bonds with shorter and longer maturities are sometimes issued.	a corporate bond is another type of corporate security , but it is quite different from stock . a bond is a formal iou issued by a corporation . while stockholders are the owners of a corporation , bondholders are its creditors . most bonds are long - term debts that mature ( come due ) 10 to 30 years after they are issued , though bonds with shorter and longer maturities are sometimes issued .
As creditors, bondholders are legally entitled to receive interest payments from the issuing corporation every year until the bond matures, and to receive an amount known as the principal (or “face value”) when the bond matures.	as creditors , bondholders are legally entitled to receive interest payments from the issuing corporation every year until the bond matures , and to receive an amount known as the principal ( or “ face value ” ) when the bond matures .

So, like stockholders, bondholders can experience capital gains or losses.	but bondholders do n't have to hold their bonds until they mature . like stocks , bonds can be bought and sold on securities markets , and their price can rise and fall . so , like stockholders , bondholders can experience capital gains or losses .

However, even bonds pose some risk.

Government securities are IOUs issued by government entities when they borrow money.

The main advantage offered by diversification is that it reduces your risk. If you put a large part of your wealth into one specific investment, you could be wiped out if that investment goes sour. If you invest in several different assets, then losses in some are likely to be offset by gains in others. But diversification also has a downside—it not only reduces risk but also reduces the possibility of earning exceptionally high returns.	the main advantage offered by diversification is that it reduces your risk . if you put a large part of your wealth into one specific investment , you could be wiped out if that investment goes sour . if you invest in several different assets , then losses in some are likely to be offset by gains in others . but diversification also has a downside — it not only reduces risk but also reduces the possibility of earning exceptionally high returns .

For example, stock prices sometimes decline sharply, so investing in stocks is considered quite risky.

In general, younger investors are less concerned about risk than older investors. When you are young, you have more time to recover from adverse results, so you may be willing to take more risks and be more aggressive in pursuit of higher returns. If you invest mostly in stocks when you are young, and the stock market crashes, you still have time to recoup your losses and take advantage of future increases in stock prices. But older investors who hold a lot of stock might find that the same crash wiped out much of the wealth just when they were counting on it to supplement their retirement income. Older investors often become more conservative, adjusting their portfolio to include a greater percentage of relatively safe assets such as government securities, bonds of corporations with strong credit ratings, and CDs.	in general , younger investors are less concerned about risk than older investors . when you are young , you have more time to recover from adverse results , so you may be willing to take more risks and be more aggressive in pursuit of higher returns . if you invest mostly in stocks when you are young , and the stock market crashes , you still have time to recoup your losses and take advantage of future increases in stock prices . but older investors who hold a lot of stock might find that the same crash wiped out much of the wealth just when they were counting on it to supplement their retirement income . older investors often become more conservative , adjusting their portfolio to include a greater percentage of relatively safe assets such as government securities , bonds of corporations with strong credit ratings , and cds .

Strategies to Become More Marketable One way to increase your marketability and your starting salary is to secure an internship during your college years. Such internships usually offer little or no monetary compensation, but they pay off in other ways. They give students a chance to gain firsthand experience that supplements what they learn in the classroom and helps them determine whether a specific career is right for them. And the internship experience looks great on a résumé. But in 2010, the U.S. Department of Labor issued a ruling that makes it more difficult for profit-seeking firms to offer unpaid or low-wage internships. Many educators, business leaders, and politicians have called on the Department of Labor to modify its stance to make internships easier to establish.	strategies to become more marketable one way to increase your marketability and your starting salary is to secure an internship during your college years . such internships usually offer little or no monetary compensation , but they pay off in other ways . they give students a chance to gain firsthand experience that supplements what they learn in the classroom and helps them determine whether a specific career is right for them . and the internship experience looks great on a résumé . but in 2010 , the u.s. department of labor issued a ruling that makes it more difficult for profit - seeking firms to offer unpaid or low - wage internships . many educators , business leaders , and politicians have called on the department of labor to modify its stance to make internships easier to establish .
