Academic Integrity Policy 

Academic integrity grows from the longstanding traditions of the world university community. 

Academic integrity is defined as a firm adherence to the code or standard of values of the University 

and the individual professions. Academic freedom is a commitment on the part of students, faculty, 

staff, and administrators even in the face of adversity, to five fundamental values: honesty, truth, 

fairness, respect, and responsibility. Commitment to academic honesty encourages the mutual 

respect and moral integrity that our University community values and nurtures. 

Academic Accommodations Policy 

Gallaudet University has a legal obligation under the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) to provide 

reasonable accommodations for students with disabilities in addition to being deaf.  Students who 

seek course accommodations, modifications, or substitutions can find guidelines and procedures for 

obtaining accommodations based on their disabilities on the Office for Students with Disabilities 

(OSWD) web site, http://www.gallaudet.edu/office_for_students_with_disabilities.html. 

Reporting Responsibilities 

While the instructor want you to feel comfortable by going to him/her with issues that you may be 

struggling with or concerns you may be having, please be aware that the instructor have some 

reporting requirements that are part of the job requirements at Gallaudet University. For example, if 

you inform the instructor of an issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or discrimination, the 

instructor will keep the information as private as he/she can, but is required to bring it to the attention 

of the Title IX Coordinator or EEO/AA office. If you would like to talk to those offices directly, they can 

be reached by contacting Sharrell McCaskill through VP (202-559-5683) or at her office in College Hall 
312 or at the following website: https://www.gallaudet.edu/title-ix-at-gallaudet-university  Additionality, 

you can also report incidents or complaints to DPS. You can also get support at CAPS (Counseling 

and Psychological Services), SHS (Student Health Services) and the Ombudsman. Another common 

example is if you are struggling with an issue that may be traumatic or unusual stress, it is the 

possibility of the instructor to inform the campus Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) or CAPS. If you 

would like to reach out directly to them for assistance, please contact them at 
https://www.gallaudet.edu/student-affairs/behavior-intervention-team  Finally, please be aware that the 

instructor is willing to listen and provide advice if needed.
