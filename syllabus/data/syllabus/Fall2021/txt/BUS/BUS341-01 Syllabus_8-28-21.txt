Assignments & Discussion Board and Movie Reviews

The assignments and the discussion board are based on twenty percent (20%) of the overall grade. The assignments will be based on the readings from each chapter and movie related to ethical issues in business. The students will discuss the movie review in class according to movie review guidelines in the Blackboard folder. The discussion board will be based on the readings and any topics related to Business Ethics. Some of the assignments, including the discussion board, will require video format as this is where you will be allowed to build technology skills while learning about the topic. The due dates for all the assignments are identified according to the weekly agenda in each week's module. If, at any time, the assignment is not turned in before the due date, you can have the opportunity to complete the assignment and get credit for the work you do is called the flex due date.



The discussion board responses must be submitted as expected by the due date because they are part of instructional hours and impact the team's learning. We cannot be behind with the discussion board as this will impact the team's learning process through the semester if the discussion board discussion isn't completed.  



Please post ALL of the assignments on Blackboard. If the Blackboard is unavailable, please email assignments to me at the email address provided at the top of the syllabus. 



To support students' learning experience through the course, if the student receives lower than 73%, they will have the option to doing only one re-do assignment with the consultation with the instructor no later than Wednesday, December 1, 2021, before 5 p.m. 



Flex Due Dates

There are four Flex due dates. There is a final cut-off at the end of every fourth week to turn in any late assignments. Please take the responsibility to complete your assignments on time and use this flexibility only if you cannot complete them due to illness, unexpected circumstances, or happen to have a very heavy week of school load to manage for a specific week. This does not include quizzes, exams, and the final exam. 



You will receive one extra point if the assignment is turned in on the actual due date and time deadline. 



If any assignments are not turned in by the flex due date will receive a grade of zero.



The first end of the fourth-week flex final due date is Tuesday, September 22, 2021, before 11:59 p.m. for the assignments between August 31, 2021, and September 21, 2021.    



The second end of the fourth week's final due date is on Wednesday, October 20, 2021, before 11:59 p.m. for the assignments between September 24, 2021, to October 19, 2021.



The third end of the fourth week's final due date is on Wednesday, November 10, 2021, before 11:59 p.m. for the assignments between October 22, 2021, to November 9, 2021.



The fourth end of the fourth week's final due date is Friday, December 3, 2021, before 11:59 p.m. for the assignments between November 12, 2021, to December 3, 2021.  



During the fourth flex period, no flex assignments will be accepted for a grade after the final flex due date on Friday, December 3, 2021. The rationale for this is that the professor needs time to grade all assignments, projects, exams, final exams and do final grading to submit the final grades on time to the Registrar's office.



Quizzes & Participation

The quizzes, attendance, and participation category are ten percent (10%) of the overall grade.

Quizzes

Each chapter quiz will be taken online. The quiz question would be based on the topic, according to discussions, or based on chapter readings. There will be three attempts to take the quiz, and the score will be based on the highest score taken.  There will be no makeup quizzes. The purpose of these quizzes is to help keep you on track and meet the chapter learning objectives. 



Expected Study Time for each quiz: 1-2 hours & Expected taking each quiz: 30 minutes – 1 hour



Participation

Why is participation important? The rationale is that each class session is designed for interaction and collaboration, so this class is a highly interactive course. This means that this will involve class/application activities, exercises, small group discussion, and other learning activities that support the learning objectives of this class. This means your preparation involving participation requires completing the reading assignments, prior preparation, interaction, collaboration, attention, effective listening, good questions, and the ability to make connections with other knowledge and experiences. It means addressing other students, not just the instructor. It doesn't mean taking all the time or just restating what was in the assigned reading.  The commitment to attending is identified as a skill & earned responsibility that is valued in the workplace. 



All of you have valuable insights and experiences that can enrich the learning context of the class. Points earned are attendance-based only and cannot be made up. The attendance points are assigned at the beginning of the semester with 100 points. There are a total of 27 classes.  Each class is 3 points except for team project presentations, exams, and the final exam. The debate session is 7 points each, the exam is 4 points each, and the final exam is 7 points. 



Students are required to attend each class. However, if the student needs to miss any class through the semester can have up to two absences with prior approval. The excused absences will also be approved in compliance with the University's COVID policy.   Students will not be permitted to make up quizzes missed since the quizzes are released early and have a due date. The assignment submission grade is separate from the attendance & participation grade. There will be no points given for any missed class and will be marked as zero in the semester's overall attendance points. 



Three (3) tardiness based on being late for class after 15 minutes and leaving the class 10 minutes before class ends equals one absence, and more than two absences lead to a grade drop from your current grade. A total of five unexcused absences equals a grade of F. Out of respect for yourself and your classmates, please be prompt to class and stay until the class is over except for excused emergencies. Please come to the class ready to work with your classmates and be involved in the learning process!



Management Ethics Team Debate Session (s)

You will work in teams to research, develop, and create a PowerPoint or similar presentation. The presentation will cover the opening statement, arguments supporting your team's position, concluding statement, rebuttal, the constructive argument of the opposing team proposition, a rebuttal of the opposing team's position, and final closure.  There are two management ethics team debate sessions with a weight of 20% of the overall final grade. Each debate session is worth 10%. Details regarding the debate session and rubrics will be provided in the Blackboard folder. Further information will be shared during class. 

													

													Objective: To build skills handling potential challenging scenarios, communicate effectively, and make ethical and reasonable decisions internally and externally. The student (s) learn how to evaluate the information they receive if identified as part of the management team making the decision or as employee-facing ethical issues.  To understand how others think even when they disagree with others. 

													

													Expected time on debate session: 10-14 hours each debate session project (Total of 20-28 hours)  



Ethics in the current news

Ethics in the current news and case studies category is based on twenty percent (20%) of the overall grade. Every day there will be more likely ethical issues happening within the world. Find an article, commercial, video, and social media post that raises an ethics issue as part of the assignment requirement. 

Two pages, double-spaced, and 12-point type font using New Roman Times

Use ethics framework model when working on the assignment 

The first question: Identify and describe the ethical issue

The second question: How to address or act on the ethics issue as a consultant

Provide a summary presentation to the class 



Objective: To practice and prepare to handle any potential ethics issue or to view the world from an ethical-moral perspective  



Case Studies

You will read the case assigned and answer the questions at the end. The case will require at least more than 1 page typed with details. Yes and No answers are not ever adequate. Look at the question the same as a good reporter would. Answer these questions, including: "Who, What, When, Where, Why, and How."  Proofread your case study, including grammar, spelling, and ensuring that your information is shared clearly, providing justifications to the answers. This includes an explanation by using examples of laws & policies to support your decision on the result of the case and what action items will be needed to handle the situation. These case studies and articles will be brought into class and discussed, including presenting your findings to classmates. Ethics in the current news and case studies category is based on twenty percent (20%) of the overall grade. 



Examinations & Final Exam

The four examinations are designed to grasp the topics and test and identify your knowledge & ability based on readings, assignments, and during the class throughout the semester, which you have learned. The four exams will cover an average of three chapters each. Each exam will consist of vocabulary words, multiple-choice questions, and short answers. The final exam will cover chapters one to twelve and debate sessions which will consist of vocabulary, multiple-choice questions, and short answers. The exams and the final exam are timed, which means you need to be prepared for the exam. It is essential to study, review and prepare for the exam in advance. The examination category is based on twenty percent (20%) of the overall grade, while the final exam category is ten percent (10%). 

													

													The expected study time for each exam is 3-5 hours each. (Total of 12-20 hours based on four exams) 

													The expected study time for the final exam is 6-8 hours.

Grades & Assignments in general 

													All course work is posted on the Blackboard Ultra Learning Management System using Word document format unless it requires PowerPoint slides or another program format. 

													

													No google drive links will be accepted because the link needs access permission, which prevents me from reading, reviewing, and correcting your completed assignments for grading.  If any google drive assignments are submitted, they will receive a grade of zero. If you have any concerns about your grade for any specific submission after being graded, you have seven (7) days from the grade submission to request a review. After the seventh day from the grade submission ends, the grade becomes final. 

													

													** All Deadlines for all the course work are due at 11:59 p.m. based on the identified day and date and according to Eastern Standard Time, including the flex due date (s). The weekly agenda posted in the Blackboard Ultra course under the weekly module folder mentions all the specific details regarding due date information.
