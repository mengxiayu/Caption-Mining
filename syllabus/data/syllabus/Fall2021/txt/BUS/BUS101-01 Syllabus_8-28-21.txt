Assignments

The assignments and the discussion board are based on twenty percent (20%) of the overall grade. The assignments will be based on the readings from each chapter. The discussion board also will be based on the readings and any topics related to Introduction to Business. Some of the assignments will require to be in video format as this is where you will be allowed to build technology skills while learning about the topic.

The discussion board responses must be submitted as expected by the due date because they are part of instructional hours and impact the team's learning. We cannot be behind with the discussion board as this will impact the team's learning process through the semester if the discussion board discussion isn't completed.  



Please post ALL of the assignments on Blackboard. If the Blackboard is unavailable, please email assignments to me at the email address provided at the top of the syllabus. 



To support students' learning experience through the course, if the student receives lower than 73%, they will have the option to doing only one re-do assignment with the consultation with the instructor no later than Wednesday, December 1, 2021, before 5 p.m. 



Flex Due Dates

There are four Flex due dates. There is a final cut-off at the end of every fourth week to turn in any late assignments. Please take the responsibility to complete your assignments on time and use this flexibility only if you cannot complete them due to illness, unexpected circumstances, or happen to have a very heavy week of school load to manage for a specific week. This does not include quizzes, exams, and the final exam. 



You will receive one extra point if the assignment is turned in on the actual due date and time deadline. 



If any assignments are not turned in by the flex due date will receive a grade of zero.



The first end of the fourth-week flex final due date is Tuesday, September 22, 2021, before 11:59 p.m. for the assignments between August 31, 2021, and September 21, 2021.    



The second end of the fourth week's final due date is on Wednesday, October 20, 2021, before 11:59 p.m. for the assignments between September 24, 2021, to October 19, 2021.



The third end of the fourth week's final due date is on Wednesday, November 10, 2021, before 11:59 p.m. for the assignments between October 22, 2021, to November 9, 2021.



The fourth end of the fourth week's final due date is Friday, December 3, 2021, before 11:59 p.m. for the assignments between November 12, 2021, to December 3, 2021.  



During the fourth flex period, no flex assignments will be accepted for a grade after the final flex due date on Friday, December 3, 2021. The rationale for this is that the professor needs time to grade all assignments, projects, exams, final exams and do final grading to submit the final grades on time to the Registrar's office.



Quizzes & Participation

The quizzes, attendance, and participation category are ten percent (10%) of the overall grade.

Quizzes

Each chapter quiz will be taken online. The quiz question would be based on the topic, according to discussions, or based on chapter readings. There will be three attempts to take the quiz, and the score will be based on the highest score taken.  There will be no makeup quizzes. The purpose of these quizzes is to help keep you on track and meet the chapter learning objectives. 



Expected Study Time for each quiz: 1-2 hours & Expected taking each quiz: 30 minutes – 1 hour



Participation

Why is participation important? The rationale is that each class session is designed for interaction and collaboration, so this class is a highly interactive course. This means that this will involve class/application activities, exercises, small group discussion, and other learning activities that support the learning objectives of this class. This means your preparation involving participation requires completing the reading assignments, prior preparation, interaction, collaboration, attention, effective listening, good questions, and the ability to make connections with other knowledge and experiences. It means addressing other students, not just the instructor. It doesn't mean taking all the time or just restating what was in the assigned reading.  The commitment to attending is identified as a skill & earned responsibility that is valued in the workplace. 



All of you have valuable insights and experiences that can enrich the learning context of the class. Points earned are attendance-based only and cannot be made up. The attendance points are assigned at the beginning of the semester with 100 points. There are a total of 28 classes.  The assignment submission grade is separate from the attendance & participation grade. The points will be deducted for any missed class, including presentation and debate sessions.  Each class is worth three points each. Each event involving a guest speaker is worth 6 points. The Peregrine Exam attendance is worth 4 points. The BizCafe Presentation attendance is worth 10 points each day, with a total of 20 points. The exam (s) and the final exams attendance are worth 2 points each with 14 points. ** The first day of class on 8/30 does not have any points.



Students are required to attend each class. However, if the student needs to miss any class through the semester can have up to two absences with prior approval. The excused absences will also be approved in compliance with the University's COVID policy.   Students will not be permitted to make up quizzes missed since the quizzes are released early and have a due date. The assignment submission grade is separate from the attendance & participation grade. There will be no points given for any missed class and will be marked as zero in the semester's overall attendance points. 



Three (3) tardiness based on being late for class after 15 minutes and leaving the class 10 minutes before class ends equals one absence, and more than two absences lead to a grade drop from your current grade. A total of five unexcused absences equals a grade of F. Out of respect for yourself and your classmates, please be prompt to class and stay until the class is over except for excused emergencies. Please come to the class ready to work with your classmates and be involved in the learning process!



Individual Project

The individual project is 10% grade-based. Two projects will be assigned during the semester. Details regarding to the project and rubrics will be provided in the Blackboard folder. Further information will be shared during class. 

													Project #1: Why Business?

													The topic of this paper is about your business interests. What areas covered by Business 101 interest you the most? What jobs or roles are most related to your areas of interest?

													Project #2: Business Analysis

													Further information will be shared via the Blackboard Ultra course. 

													

														Expected time on this project: 2-3 hours 



Team Project 

The BizCafe Team Project is fifteen percent (15%) grade-based. The BizCafe project gives the student an opportunity to learn the fundamentals of business. The students will experience similar scenarios of real-world challenges in the business world managing different functions of the business of accounting, finance, marketing, staffing, operations, managing day to day operations, and distribution and pricing.

Exams

													The examinations are worth thirty percent (30%) together with the overall grade. Each exam is worth five percent (5%). The six examinations are designed to test your knowledge and grasp of the topics covered in the class throughout the entire semester. The exams will cover three chapters of the Textbook. The examinations will be based on topics covered in chapter quizzes and will consist of vocabulary words, short answers, and multiple-choice questions. 

													

													The expected study time for each exam is 2-3 hours each. (Total of 12-18 hours based on six exams) 

													

													The final examination is worth ten percent (10%) of the overall grade.  The final exam is based on cumulative of chapter 1 to 17 and personal finance appendix and will consit of vocabulary words, multiple-choice questions, and short answers. 

Grades & Assignments in general 

													All course work is posted on the Blackboard Ultra Learning Management System using Word document format unless it requires PowerPoint slides or another program format. 

													

													No google drive links will be accepted because the link needs access permission, which prevents me from reading, reviewing, and correcting your completed assignments for grading.  If any google drive assignments are submitted, they will receive a grade of zero. 

													

													If you have any concerns about your grade for any specific submission after being graded, you have seven (7) days from the grade submission to request a review. After the seventh day from the grade submission ends, the grade becomes final. 

													

													** All Deadlines for all the course work are due at 11:59 p.m. based on the identified day and date and according to Eastern Standard Time, including the flex due date (s). The weekly agenda posted in the Blackboard Ultra course under the weekly module folder mentions all the specific details regarding due date information.
