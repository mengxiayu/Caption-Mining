Attendance and Participation (10% of Grade)



You will be graded on your mastery of the textbook material and other course content through in-class activities including, but not limited to, pop quizzes, class exercises, team activities, and case studies. They will be assigned as needed throughout the semester and count toward the participation grade.



Participation in our classroom sessions is an essential component of learning in this course. Your participation in class discussion and collaboration activities help you digest and master concepts and skills taught in this course, and improve your problem-solving skills in business situations. So, attendance is strongly expected, and I will be marking your attendance and participation during the designated times we are meeting for the class sessions, which are Tuesdays and Thursdays from 9:30am to 10:50am Eastern Time.



Three unexcused absences are permitted. Absences beyond the 3-absence limit, frequent lateness, and any class behavior issues will impact your activities/participation grade. Frequent absences and/or significant class behavior issues will result in zero credit for the activities/participation grade for the semester. If the absences are extremely excessive (more than 50% of class sessions) and/or there are major class behavior issues that disrupt the course learning environment, a low or failing grade will be given for the entire course.



Only absences due to medical and family reasons – with proper documentation such as a medical note – will be excused. Emails that explain why you are absent (“I overslept”, “I ate something bad in my dinner last night”, etc.) will not be accepted as excused absences. Only valid documentation is accepted.



Quizzes (10% of grade)

A quiz will be given for each assigned textbook chapter, with a mix of multiple-choice and short-answer questions. They will be given as either a take-home or in-class quiz depending on the content of the quiz.



Expected study time for each quiz: 1-2 hours





New Product Proposal (70% of Grade)



For the New Product Proposal, you will work on a product idea of your own, subject to instructor’s approval. The project will consist of nine (9) modules, each representing 1/9th of the assignment grade. At the end of the semester, you will propose and defend your product idea and explain the product development process for this idea.



Expected study time on each module: 2-6 hours (depending on difficulty of each module).

COURSE SCHEDULE



The schedule for the course is listed on the next page. It is important that you follow the reading and case assignments, as much of your learning will occur through class discussions. Any missed readings or cases on your part will impact the quality of the class discussion for everyone in the class. Additional readings will be announced in class and on Blackboard.





Credit Hour Compliance

This course earns 3 credits; therefore, it will meet for at least 37.5 hours of instructional time and students are expected to spend at least 75 hours on outside-of-class preparation (e.g., readings, assignments, papers, etc.). These two sums should result in total student engagement time of 112.5 hours for the course. Note that these time allotments are minimums, not maximums.



Statement Regarding Possibility of Syllabus and/or Schedule Change:  

At times, topics shown in this syllabus may be taught in a different sequence, new topics added, and others adjusted. This will ensure the relevancy of the course and enhance your learning.  Please be prepared to be flexible and adjust as this class evolves. All assignments and specifics are noted on the board at the start of each class.  All notifications of changes will be done through Blackboard announcements and emails.



CLASS POLICIES:



Gallaudet University Academic Integrity Policy:  

Do not plagiarize in this or any other Gallaudet University class.  If you see a good idea and use it in a paper, presentation, or even a comment in class, add the author’s name before or after your comment.  This goes for when you exactly quote something or even when you just mention an idea from the author. All students must comply with the Gallaudet University Academic Integrity Policy. Using other people’s work as your own or using the same work for another class for this one is dishonest and only cheating yourself out of a good education. It is your responsibility to understand and follow this policy. The official policy can be found at

http://www.gallaudet.edu/academic-catalog/registration-and-policies/undergraduate-policies/academic-integrity.html

Gallaudet Undergraduate Academic Calendar

It is your responsibility to familiarize yourself with Gallaudet University’s Academic Calendar with respect to when classes meet and holidays are.  The Academic Calendar can be found at the Gallaudet University website at http://www.gallaudet.edu/registrars-office/academic-calendars/undergraduate-2016-2017.html



OSWD Academic Accommodation Policy: 

Students who require accommodations need to register with the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSWD) located in SAC 1022 in order to have their status certified and recorded. OSWD will contact the instructors to arrange for accommodation, but only after certification has been determined. No accommodation can be provided prior to authorization by OSWD. For more information about OSWD policy, go to http://www.gallaudet.edu/academic-catalog/registration-and-policies/undergraduate-policies/academic-accommodations-policy.html



ADA Compliance 

For information on your rights under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act, please see https://www.gallaudet.edu/af/section-1-general/110-reasonable-accommodation.html



Class Cancellation or University Closing:

If the university closes for any reason or the instructor unexpectedly misses class, that day’s work will be conducted via Blackboard. Check the announcement section of Blackboard for specific instructions, which will be posted by class time if at all possible.



Reporting Responsibilities under Title IX:

While I want you to feel comfortable coming to me with issues you may be struggling with or concerns you may be having, please be aware that I have some reporting requirements that are part of my job requirements at Gallaudet University.



For example, if you inform me of an issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or discrimination I will keep the information as private as I can, but I am required to bring it to the attention of the Title IX Coordinator or EEO/AA office. If you would like to talk to those offices directly, they can be reached by contacting Sharrell McCaskill through VP (202-559-5683) or at her office in College Hall 312 or at the following website: https://www.gallaudet.edu/title-ix-at-gallaudet-university. Additionally, you can also report incidents or complaints to DPS. You can also get support at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services), SHS (Student Health Services) and the Ombuds Office. 



Another common example is if you are struggling with an issue that may be traumatic or unusual stress. I will likely inform the campus Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) or CAPS. If you would like to reach out directly to them for assistance, you can contact them at https://www.gallaudet.edu/student-affairs/behavior-intervention-team. 



Finally, know that I am always willing to listen and give advice if needed.
