Reporting Responsibilities

While I want you to feel comfortable coming to me with issues you may be struggling with or concerns you may be having, please be aware that I have some reporting requirements that are part of my job requirements at Gallaudet University. For example, if you inform me of an issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or discrimination I will keep the information as private as I can, but I am required to bring it to the attention of the Title IX Coordinator or EEO/AA office. If you would like to talk to those offices directly, they can be reached by contacting Sharrell McCaskill through VP (202-559-5683) or at her office in College Hall 312 or at the following website: https://www.gallaudet.edu/title-ix-at-gallaudet-university. Additionally, you can also report incidents or complaints to DPS. You can also get support at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services), SHS (Student Health Services) and the Ombudsman. Business Law II Syllabus Page 7 of 9 Fall Semester 2020 Another common example is if you are struggling with an issue that may be traumatic or unusual stress. I will likely inform the campus Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) or CAPS. If you would like to reach out directly to them for assistance, you can contact them at https://www.gallaudet.edu/student-affairs/behavior-intervention-team. Finally, know that I am always willing to listen and give advice if needed

Masking Requirements

The university has a mask policy that utilizes three colors: green, yellow and red. Please click on this link to read about the university’s mask policy: Gallaudet University mask policy. 

Under the current Yellow Mask Policy Status, all faculty and students are required to wear masks indoors, including in face-to-face classes that are held indoors. We have ordered a very large supply of clear masks that fit above the nose and under the chin. It takes some time to get used to them but please follow the mask posted mask status.  

Mask Etiquette

As we monitor the Mask Status (Green, Yellow, Red) to determine when and where we must mask-up, there may be certain students, faculty, and/or staff who may wish to mask-up even if they are not required to. This decision might cause stigma/taboo by others which might lead to assumptions that they are not vaccinated, which we know not to be always true. We have students who are vaccinated who prefer to wear masks all the time or  are medically unable to be vaccinated so please be sensitive to their position with respect and civility. 

What Will Happen if People Refuse to Wear a Mask

We expect that most if not all people will respect the indoor mask policy. If a person refuses to wear a mask in class or takes off their mask and does not put it back on, they will be asked to leave the class immediately and meet with their instructor about the incident. The instructor is required to report such incidents to Student Accountability Restorative Practice (SARP) immediately after class with the student’s name and a summary of the incident. SARP will follow up right away with the student. Such incidents may lead to disciplinary action. 

Safety on Campus

We are back on campus and the university is fully open. Our administration, staff and faculty have worked hard to make our campus as safe as possible. We have required everyone to be vaccinated or to be approved for a waiver (which requires strict mask-wearing requirements indoors and outdoors). We now require everyone, vaccinated or not, to wear masks indoors as part of DC Health requirements and the Yellow Mask Policy Status. Weekly COVID testing is required for all members of our community, and everyone is required to submit a health screening each time they enter our campus. With all of these requirements in place, we are hopeful that we can provide a positive educational experience for our students on campus. In turn, we ask our students to observe safety protocols and to make sensible and healthy decisions for themselves both on and off campus that will protect themselves and others from possible COVID exposure.

There Will be No Virtual Versions of Courses that are Face - to - Face

We all know how important face-to-face engagement is to our learning mission. We understand  that there are concerns from students about participating in person. Some students have individually approached their faculty or advisors to ask for virtual versions of face-to-face courses. Faculty teaching in person will not make course content for the semester available asynchronously online or to offer hyflex options (where some students attend in person and others join via zoom).

Student Absences for Quarantine and/or Health Reasons

Students or faculty may become ill during the semester. In these situations, we will follow public health and safety protocols.

Quarantine. A number of students will need to quarantine upon arrival in Washington, DC based on guidelines from the DC Department of Health for unvaccinated or partially vaccinated individuals traveling to the area. Faculty with affected students in their classes,  have been asked to work with them on a short-term basis to allow them to complete coursework while quarantining. Students in this situation should notify their instructors  directly of their circumstances. 

Health absences. Similarly, students may need to miss classes throughout the semester for health reasons. Given that we want any student who is experiencing symptoms of illness to refrain from attending in-person classes, we have asked faculty to be flexible in granting short-term excused absences (i.e., one to two classes). The Office of the Dean of Student Affairs will provide notice of absence for those students who need to take more prolonged absences or undergo quarantine/isolation.  

Faculty will support students who become ill during the semester as normal. Your instructors will share PowerPoints or other in-class materials electronically, allow for extensions on assignments, and ensure that students’ participation grades are not negatively impacted. Students should be expected to make up for any missed work.

Contact Tracing. The university will continue to test and contact trace for anyone who tests positive for COVID-19 within our community and will notify instructors, support staff, and classmates if an individual was in their presence while potentially infectious. If a student, faculty, or staff member learns that an individual with whom they’ve interacted tested positive but does not receive official notification, they should assume that contact tracing has determined that the interaction took place outside that person’s infectious period. Faculty and staff should direct questions to coronavirus@gallaudet.edu and suspected exposure to contact.tracing@gallaudet.edu.
