Types of Learning Activities



Textbook Reading

Each module is associated with an appropriate chapter of the textbook aided with the online resources provided by the publisher. This course is much more than memorization of procedures, formulas, and formats. Although we may use numerical examples, everything in the course is theory-driven. A thorough reading and rereading of the textbook are essential.

Homework/Project

Each module contains the exercises that should be completed using the Connect software provided by the publisher along with the textbook. This is essential for thorough mastery of financial accounting concepts and their applications. Failure to practice problem material usually results in the students being unable to efficiently work examination problems in the time allotted. There will be times when the homework challenges you. That is intentional. Part of your training to enter the professional accounting and business world is to be able to do something that is a challenge.

While homework can be taken with an unlimited attempt, there is only two attempts to complete the assignments for the project. The assignments for Project include mostly Excel stimulations.

Quiz/Tests

There will be quizzes and tests for each module. They should be completed on time scheduled according to the course schedule. The quizzes/tests that are not submitted after the assigned week count zero. No student can be excused from missing assignments. 

Course Schedule

The course schedule for this class is shown in detail at the end of this syllabus.

Credit Hour Compliance

This course earns 3 credits; therefore, students will spend 150 minutes in class per week for 15 weeks, resulting in 37.5 hours of instructional time for the semester. Students are expected to spend at least 5 hours per week for a total of 75 hours on outside-of-class preparation (e.g. readings, assignments). These two sums should result in a total student engagement time of 112.5 hours for the course. Note that these time allotments are minimums, not maximums.

Statement Regarding Possibility of Syllabus and/or Schedule Change

At times, topics shown in this syllabus may be taught in a different sequence, new topics added, and others adjusted. This will ensure the relevancy of the course and enhance your learning.  Please be prepared to be flexible and adjust as this class evolves. All assignments and specifics are noted on the board at the start of each class.  All notifications of changes will be done through Blackboard announcements and emails.




Class Policies

Gallaudet University Academic Integrity Policy 

Do not plagiarize in this or any other Gallaudet University class.  If you see a good idea and use it in a paper, presentation, or even a comment in class, add the author’s name before or after your comment.  This goes for when you exactly quote something or even when you just mention an idea from the author. All students must comply with the Gallaudet University Academic Integrity Policy. Using other people’s work as your own or using the same work for another class for this one is dishonest and only cheating yourself out of a good education. It is your responsibility to understand and follow this policy. The official policy can be found at https://www.gallaudet.edu/student-affairs/student-handbook/university-policies-and-procedures.

Gallaudet Undergraduate Academic Calendar

It is the student’s responsibility to familiarize themselves with Gallaudet University’s Academic Calendar with respect to when classes meet and holidays are.  The Academic Calendar can be found at the Gallaudet University website at https://www.gallaudet.edu/registrar/academic-calendars/undergraduate-academic-calendar.



OSWD Academic Accommodation Policy: 

Students who require accommodations need to register with the Office for Students with Disabilities (OSWD) in order to have their status certified and recorded. OSWD will contact the instructors to arrange for accommodation, but only after certification has been determined. No accommodation can be provided prior to authorization by OSWD. For more information about OSWD policy, go to https://www.gallaudet.edu/office-for-students-with-disabilities/oswd-area/oswd-handbook/.



ADA Compliance 

For information on your rights under the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation ACT, please see https://www.gallaudet.edu/office-for-students-with-disabilities/oswd-handbook-for-students-faculty-and-staff/appendix-a-disability-law/a1-oswd-and-compliance-at-gallaudet.



Reporting Responsibilities:

While I want you to feel comfortable coming to me with issues you may be struggling with or concerns you may be having, please be aware that I have some reporting requirements that are part of my job requirements at Gallaudet University.

For example, if you inform me of an issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or discrimination I will keep the information as private as I can, but I am required to bring it to the attention of the Title IX Coordinator or EEO/AA office. If you would like to talk to those offices directly, they can be reached by contacting Sharrell McCaskill through VP (202-559-5683) or at her office in College Hall 312 or at the following website: https://www.gallaudet.edu/title-ix/. Additionally, you can also report incidents or complaints to DPS. You can also get support at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services), SHS (Student Health Services) and the Ombudsman. 

Another common example is if you are struggling with an issue that may be traumatic or unusual stress. I will likely inform the campus Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) or CAPS. If you would like to reach out directly to them for assistance, you can contact them at https://www.gallaudet.edu/student-affairs/behavior-intervention-team/.

Finally, know that I am always willing to listen and give advice if needed. 

Class Cancellation or University Closing:

If the university closes for any reason or the instructor unexpectedly miss class, that day’s work will be conducted via Blackboard. Check the announcement section of Blackboard for specific instructions, which will be posted by class time if at all possible.



Masking Requirements

The university has a mask policy that utilizes three colors: green, yellow, and red. Please click on this link to read about the university’s mask policy: Gallaudet University mask policy. 

Under the current Yellow Mask Policy Status, all faculty and students are required to wear masks indoors, including in face-to-face classes that are held indoors. We have ordered a very large supply of clear masks that fit above the nose and under the chin. It takes some time to get used to them but please follow the mask posted mask status.  

Mask Etiquette

As we monitor the Mask Status (Green, Yellow, Red) to determine when and where we must mask up, there may be certain students, faculty, and/or staff who may wish to mask up even if they are not required to. This decision might cause stigma/taboo by others which might lead to assumptions that they are not vaccinated, which we know not to be always true. We have students who are vaccinated who prefer to wear masks all the time or are medically unable to be vaccinated so please be sensitive to their position with respect and civility. 

What Will Happen if People Refuse to Wear a Mask

We expect that most if not all people will respect the indoor mask policy. If a person refuses to wear a mask in class or takes off their mask and does not put it back on, they will be asked to leave the class immediately and meet with their instructor about the incident. The instructor is required to report such incidents to Student Accountability Restorative Practice (SARP) immediately after class with the student’s name and a summary of the incident. SARP will follow up right away with the student. Such incidents may lead to disciplinary action.
