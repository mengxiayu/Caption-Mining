Responsibility for Assignments:



Textbook Reading:  Students must read all Textbook assignments (chapters and cases).  All hour exams and the questions appearing on the exams assume this has been done.



Homework problems & exercises:  Diligent homework preparation is essential for thorough mastery of Government and Non-Profit Accounting.  Failure to do exercises and problem material assigned for homework usually results in a student being unable to efficiently work examination problems in the time allotted.  There will be times when the homework challenges you and this is intentional.  Part of your training to enter the professional accounting world is to be able to meet challenges.  Homework is due at the beginning of the class.  On all assignments where computations are involved, you must SHOW YOUR WORK to receive credit.



Proper format for flow charts, schedules, and narratives is required.  Assignments which are not neat, legible, and organized will be penalized.  Multi-page assignments should be stapled together.



Quizzes



	We will have quizzes for each chapter covered throughout the fall semester (announced ahead of time in the syllabus).  The two lowest quiz scores will be dropped (including missed quizzes so your best scores will count.  Quizzes will be given in class only.  If you miss class on a quiz day, the missed quiz score will be considered as your drop.  To do well on the quiz, you must read and study each chapter of the textbook carefully.  I use the quizzes to assess your preparation for class as well as your reading skill.  By studying the textbook and doing the question assignments, you will be well prepared for the quiz and class discussions.

Major Assignments and Grading Policy:  

Grade is based on:

Teamwork/Case Study Assignments			           10%

Questions/Exercise/Problems				15%

Quizzes							10%

Hour Tests							65%

							          100%

Credit Hour Compliance:

Please note that Gallaudet’s policy is that in each three-credit hour traditional in-class course, students spend 150 minutes in class per week for 15 weeks, resulting in 37.5 contact hours for the semester. Students are expected to engage in reading and other assignments outsides of class for at least 5 hours per week, which adds up to 75 hours. These two sums should result in total student engagement time of 112.5 hours for the course. Note that these time allotments are minimums, not maximums.

Navigate Syllabus Statement

Throughout the term, you may receive Navigate emails from me regarding your course grades or academic performance. Please pay attention to these emails and follow through with the recommended actions to be successful in this course. Upon getting a Navigate email, please see me to discuss your academic progress. Your advisor may also ask to see you to discuss your progress to ensure that you are receiving the support you need to succeed in the course.

Reporting Responsibilities:

While I want you to feel comfortable coming to me with issues you may be struggling with or concerns you may be having, please be aware that I have some reporting requirements that are part of my job requirements at Gallaudet University.

For example, if you inform me of an issue of sexual harassment, sexual assault, or discrimination I will keep the information as private as I can, but I am required to bring it to the attention of the Title IX Coordinator or EEO/AA office. If you would like to talk to those offices directly, they can be reached by contacting Sharrell McCaskill through VP (202-559-5683) or at her office in College Hall 312 or at the following website: https://www.gallaudet.edu/title-ix-at-gallaudet-university. Additionally, you can also report incidents or complaints to DPS. You can also get support at CAPS (Counseling and Psychological Services), SHS (Student Health Services) and the Ombudsman. 

Another common example is if you are struggling with an issue that may be traumatic or unusual stress. I will likely inform the campus Behavioral Intervention Team (BIT) or CAPS. If you would like to reach out directly to them for assistance, you can contact them at https://www.gallaudet.edu/student-affairs/behavior-intervention-team. 

Finally, know that I am always willing to listen and give advice if needed. 



Use of Gallaudet Blackboard Learning System:

The course information and records will be managed through Blackboard.  Specifically, Blackboard will be used to record grades and to post announcements, homework, course updates, and other curricular materials.  Blackboard will also be used to send out course related e-mails.  If you are using a private email, please forward your Gallaudet email to your preferred email account, so you will not miss message from me.



Class Cancellation or University Closing:

If the university closes for any reason or the instructor unexpectedly miss class, that day’s work will be conducted via Blackboard. Check the announcement section of Blackboard for specific instructions, which will be posted by class time if possible.

														

Statement Regarding Possibility of Syllabus and/or Schedule Change:  

At times, topics shown in this syllabus may be taught in a different sequence, new topics added, and others adjusted. This will ensure the relevancy of the course and enhance your learning.  Please be prepared to be flexible and adjust as this class evolves. All assignments and specifics are noted on the board at the start of each class.

Contributing to class (asking & answering questions, contributing to the group, asking reasonable questions, being prepared).









Absences:

Only 3 absences are allowed this fall semester.  Students who have unexcused absences may be asked to withdraw from the course.



Examination Policy:

It is the student’s responsibility to take tests on the assigned dates.  There will be 4 scheduled tests as noted on your course schedule.  A typical course examination includes multiple choice, essay questions, matching, fill in the blanks, and problem-solving exercises.  No make-up tests will be given.  No student can be excused from or cut a test unless he/she is in the infirmary or produces a note from doctor on his/her RX stationary stating that you were too ill to take the test.  Missing test counts zero for that test.  The student is responsible to schedule appointment with the instructor to discuss the missing test.

Bathroom privileges are suspended during the examinations.



Calculators:

Students are encouraged to bring calculators to class.  The use of calculators during examinations is highly recommended.  However, for obvious reasons, the following calculators are not allowed during examinations: pager calculators and those with either multi-line display or those allow the input and display of alphabetic characters.  For example, (TI-83, TI-84, etc.) graphic calculators are not allowed during examination.
