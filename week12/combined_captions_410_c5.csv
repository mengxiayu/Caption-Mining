Going to think of as flipping a coin. But now we have multiple is. First we can flip a coin to decide whether we will talk about the background. So it's the background.

The probability that the world is generated from the background model is Lambda multiplied by the probability of the world from the background model, right? Two things must happen.

A topical theta sub k. Now notice that here's a product of three terms, and that's the cause. The choice of topic theta sub k. K only happens if two things happen. One is we decided not to talk about background, so that's probability 1 minus Lambda sub b. Second, we also have to actually choose. Set us up. K among these K topics. So that's probability of serious up cake or pie. And similarly, the probability of generating the water from the second topic and his first topic popular like what you're seeing here and then. So in the end, the probability of observing the world is just a sum of all these cases.	ok , so similarly we can figure out the probability of observe the world from another topic . a topical theta sub k. now notice that here be a product of three term , and that be the cause . the choice of topic theta sub k.

That's your starting point and then you try to improve this by moving this to another point where you can have a higher like recorder. So that's the idea of Hill climbing.

We have K categories here. Now we can use a regular text for categorization technique to solve this problem, but such a solution would not consider the order and dependency of the categories. Intuitively, the features that can distinguish Category 2 from 1 or rather rating 2 from 1 may be similar to those that can distinguish K from K - 1. For example, positive words generally suggest a higher rating.	we have an opinionate text document d as input an we want to generate as output already in the range of one through k , so it be discrete rating and thus this be a categorization problem . we have k category here . now we can use a regular text for categorization technique to solve this problem , but such a solution would not consider the order and dependency of the category . intuitively , the feature that can distinguish Category 2 from 1 or rather rate 2 from 1 may be similar to those that can distinguish K from K - 1 . for example , positive word generally suggest a high rating .

In general, we can add order to classify and there are many different approaches, and here we are going to talk about one of them is called the ordinal logistic regression. Now let's first think about how we use logistic regression for binary setting categorization problem. So suppose we just want to distinguish it positive from negative and then it's just a two category categorization problem. So the predictors are represented as X and these are the features and there are M features altogether, which feature value is a real number, and this can be representation of a text document.	so what be the solution ? in general , we can add order to classify and there be many different approach , and here we be go to talk about one of they be call the ordinal logistic regression . now let 's first think about how we use logistic regression for binary set categorization problem . so suppose we just want to distinguish it positive from negative and then it be just a two category categorization problem . so the predictor be represent as X and these be the feature and there be M feature altogether , which feature value be a real number , and this can be representation of a text document .

And then of course, this is a standard two category categorization problem. We can apply logistical regression. You may recall that in logistic regression we assume the log of probability that Y is equal to 1 is assumed to be a linear function of these features as shown here.	and y have two value , binary response variable { 0,1 } . 1 mean x be positive , 0 mean x be negative . and then of course , this be a standard two category categorization problem . we can apply logistical regression . you may recall that in logistic regression we assume the log of probability that Y be equal to 1 be assume to be a linear function of these feature as show here .

We actually use such a binary logistic regression program to solve this multi level rating prediction. And the idea is we can introduce multiple binary classifiers and each case we ask the classifier to predict whether the rating is J or above all the ratings lower than J. So when Y_j is equal to 1, it means rating is J or above. When it's zero, that means the rating is lower than J.	what if we have multiple category , multiple level ? we actually use such a binary logistic regression program to solve this multi level rating prediction . and the idea be we can introduce multiple binary classifier and each case we ask the classifier to predict whether the rating be J or above all the rating low than J.

That's classifier two, and in the end we need a classifier to distinguish two and one	so basically , if we want to predict rating in the range of one through k , we first have one classifier to distinguish K versus other . and that be our classifier one , and then we be go to have another classifier to distinguish K - 1 from the rest . that be classifier two , and in the end we need a classifier to distinguish two and one

So, for example, we might pick a particular coverage, let's say in this case.	now here , because we consider context so the distribution of topic or the coverage of topic can vary depend on the context that have influence the coverage . so , for example , we might pick a particular coverage , let 's say in this case .

So what it means we're going to use the coverage to choose a topic to choose one of these three topics. Let's say we have picked up, let's say, the yellow topic, then withdraw a word from this particular topic on the top.	we pick we 've pick the document specifically coverage now with the coverage and these word distribution , we can generate the document in exactly the same way as in PLSA . so what it mean we be go to use the coverage to choose a topic to choose one of these three topic . let 's say we have pick up , let 's say , the yellow topic , then withdraw a word from this particular topic on the top .

So in other words, we have extra switches that are tied to this context that would control the choices of different views of topics and choices of coverage. And naturally, the model will have more parameters to estimate, but once we can estimate those parameters that involve the context, then we will be able to understand the context of specific views of topics or context specific coverages of topics. And this is precisely what we want in contextual text mining.	now , so the main difference be when we obtain the coverage and the word distribution , we let the context influence our choice . so in other word , we have extra switch that be tie to this context that would control the choice of different view of topic and choice of coverage . and naturally , the model will have more parameter to estimate , but once we can estimate those parameter that involve the context , then we will be able to understand the context of specific view of topic or context specific coverage of topic . and this be precisely what we want in contextual text mining .

So first, let's look at the concept of topic. So topic is something that we all understand, I think, but it's actually not that easy to formally define it. Roughly speaking, topic is the main idea discussed in text data, and you can think of this as a theme or subject of discussion or conversation. It can also have different granularities. For example, we can talk about the topic of a sentence.	in this lecture we be go to talk about its motivation and the task definition . so first , let 's look at the concept of topic . so topic be something that we all understand , I think , but it be actually not that easy to formally define it . roughly speak , topic be the main idea discuss in text datum , and you can think of this as a theme or subject of discussion or conversation . it can also have different granularity . for example , we can talk about the topic of a sentence .

Here are some examples. For example, we might be interested in knowing what are Twitter users talking about today? Are they talking about NBA sports or talking about some international events, etc. Or we are interested in knowing about the research topics. For example, one might be interested in knowing what are the current research topics in data mining and how are they different from those five years ago. Now this involves discovery of topics in data mining, literatures and also we want to discover topics in today's literature and those in the past. And then we can make a comparison. We might be also interested in knowing what do people like about some product like iPhone 6 an what do they dislike? And this involves discovering topics in positive opinions about iPhone 6 and also negative reviews about it.	indeed , there be many application that require discovery of topic in text and then analyze they . here be some example . for example , we might be interested in know what be Twitter user talk about today ? be they talk about NBA sport or talk about some international event , etc . or we be interested in know about the research topic . for example , one might be interested in know what be the current research topic in data mining and how be they different from those five year ago . now this involve discovery of topic in data mining , literature and also we want to discover topic in today 's literature and those in the past . and then we can make a comparison . we might be also interested in know what do people like about some product like iPhone 6 an what do they dislike ? and this involve discover topic in positive opinion about iPhone 6 and also negative review about it .

For example, we might know the time associated with the text data or locations where the text data will produced or the authors of text or the sources of the text etc. All such meta data or context variables can be associated with the topics that we discover. And then we can use these context variables to help us analyze patterns of topics. For example, looking at topics overtime, we would be able to discover whether there's a trending topic or some topics might be fading away.	now when we have some non - text datum then we can have more context for analyze the topic . for example , we might know the time associate with the text datum or location where the text datum will produce or the author of text or the source of the text etc . all such meta datum or context variable can be associate with the topic that we discover . and then we can use these context variable to help we analyze pattern of topic . for example , look at topic overtime , we would be able to discover whether there be a trending topic or some topic might be fade away .

The first is to discover K topics from a collection of text data. What are these K topics? OK, major topics in the text data. The second task is to figure out which documents cover which topics to what extent. So more formally, we can define the problem as follows. First, we have as input a collection of N text documents. Here we can denote that text connection. as C. And denote a text article as d i an we generally also need to have an input the number of topics K. But there may be techniques that can automatically suggest a number of topics, but in the techniques that we will discuss which are also the most useful techniques, we often need to specify a number of topics.	etc . , right ? so now you can see there be generally two different task or subtask . the first be to discover k topic from a collection of text datum . what be these k topic ? ok , major topic in the text datum . the second task be to figure out which document cover which topic to what extent . so more formally , we can define the problem as follow . first , we have as input a collection of n text document . here we can denote that text connection . as C. and denote a text article as d I an we generally also need to have an input the number of topic K. but there may be technique that can automatically suggest a number of topic , but in the technique that we will discuss which be also the most useful technique , we often need to specify a number of topic .

Also we want to generate the coverage of topics in each document di and this is denoted by π sub i j and "π sub i j document d sub i covering topic theta sub j. So obviously for each document we have a set of such values indicate.	now the output would then be the k topic that we would like to discover denote as theater sub one through theta sub k. also we want to generate the coverage of topic in each document di and this be denote by π sub I j and " π sub I j document d sub I cover topic theta sub j.

This problem has not been completely defined until we define what is exactly theta.	an we can assume that these probability sum to one , because a document wo n't be able to cover other topic outside the topic that we discuss we discover . so now the question be how do we define \theta sub I ? how do we define the topic now ? this problem have not be completely define until we define what be exactly theta .

The basic idea is to help humans to create test collection. Where we already every document is tagged with the desired categories, or in the case of search for which query, which documents should have been retrieved and this is called ground truth.	so first some general thought about the evaluation in general for evaluation of this kind of empirical task such as categorisation , we use methodology that be develop in 1960s by information retrieval researcher call Cranfield Evaluation Methodology . the basic idea be to help human to create test collection . where we already every document be tag with the desire category , or in the case of search for which query , which document should have be retrieve and this be call ground truth .

So here you show that here you see that there are K categories denoted by C1 through CK and there are N documents in order by D1 through DN an for each pair of a category on the document that we can then look at the situation.	so the first measure that we will introduce be call classification accuracy , and this be basically to measure the percentage of corrective decision . so here you show that here you see that there be K category denote by C1 through CK and there be n document in order by D1 through DN an for each pair of a category on the document that we can then look at the situation .

Basically has assigned this category to this document or no, so this is denoted by Y or N. That's the system to decision. And similarly we can look at the humans decision. Also, if the human has assigned a category to the document, there will be a plus sign here. That's just that just means a human would think this assignment is correct an if the incorrect, and then there's a minus. So we will see. All combinations of these ends yes and Nos with minus and plus. So there are four combinations in total and two of them are correct and when we have Y plus or minus and then there are also two kinds of errors. So the measure of classification accuracy is similar to count how many of these decisions are correct and normalize that by the total number of decisions we have made. So we know that the total number of decisions is.	and see if the system have say yes to despair . basically have assign this category to this document or no , so this be denote by Y or N. that be the system to decision . and similarly we can look at the human decision . also , if the human have assign a category to the document , there will be a plus sign here . that be just that just mean a human would think this assignment be correct an if the incorrect , and then there be a minus . so we will see . all combination of these end yes and Nos with minus and plus . so there be four combination in total and two of they be correct and when we have Y plus or minus and then there be also two kind of error . so the measure of classification accuracy be similar to count how many of these decision be correct and normalize that by the total number of decision we have make . so we know that the total number of decision be .

So we can first categorize all the objects in tune. It's a small number of high level categories an inside each category. We can further categorize into sub categories etc. So why is text categories important well, I already showed you several applications, but in general there are several reasons. One is text Categorization helps us enrich text representation, and that's to achieve more understanding of text data that's always useful for text analysis. So now with categorisation, text can be represented in multiple levels, meaning keyword bag of words representation has often used for a lot of text processing tasks. But we can also add categories and they provide 2 levels of representation.	and the hierarchical category categorisation can also be do by progressively do flat categorisation at each level . so we can first categorize all the object in tune . it be a small number of high level category an inside each category . we can far categorize into sub category etc . so why be text category important well , I already show you several application , but in general there be several reason . one be text categorization help we enrich text representation , and that be to achieve more understanding of text datum that be always useful for text analysis . so now with categorisation , text can be represent in multiple level , mean keyword bag of word representation have often use for a lot of text processing task . but we can also add category and they provide 2 level of representation .

The obvious entities that can be directly connected are authors, but you can also imagine the authors affiliations or the authors ages and other things can be actually connected to text data indirectly. Once we can make the connection, then we can make predictions about those values. So this is a general way to allow us to use text mining tool. Sorry, text categorization to discover knowledge about the world. Very useful, especially in big text data. Analytics, where we are often interested in using text data as extra sensor data collected from humans to infer certain desicion factors. Often together with non text data specifically to text. For example, we can also think of examples of inferring properties of entities. For example discovery of non native speakers of a language and this can be done by categorizing the content of.	so it be useful to think about the information network that will connect the other entity with text datum . the obvious entity that can be directly connect be author , but you can also imagine the author affiliation or the author age and other thing can be actually connect to text datum indirectly . once we can make the connection , then we can make prediction about those value . so this be a general way to allow we to use text mining tool . sorry , text categorization to discover knowledge about the world . very useful , especially in big text datum . analytic , where we be often interested in use text datum as extra sensor datum collect from human to infer certain desicion factor . often together with non text datum specifically to text . for example , we can also think of example of infer property of entity . for example discovery of non native speaker of a language and this can be do by categorize the content of .

So our hidden variable Z now, which is a topic indicator, can take more than two values. Specifically, will take a K plus one values with B denoting the background and one through K to denote all the K topics. So now the E step as you can recall is augmented data and by predicting the values of the hidden variable. So we're going to predict for word whether the word has come from one of these K+1 distributions. This equation allows us to predict the probability that the word W in Document "D is generated from topic theta sub j	so in the e - step , we now have to introduce more hidden variable because we have more topic . so our hidden variable Z now , which be a topic indicator , can take more than two value . specifically , will take a k plus one value with B denote the background and one through K to denote all the K topic . so now the e step as you can recall be augment datum and by predict the value of the hidden variable . so we be go to predict for word whether the word have come from one of these k+1 distribution . this equation allow we to predict the probability that the word W in Document " d be generate from topic theta sub j

Because Whether a word is from a particular topic, actually depends on the document. Can you see why? Well, it's through the pi. The pis are tied to each document. Each document can have a potentially different pis, right? The pis will then affect our prediction, so the pis are here, and this depends on the document.	note that we use document d here to index the word . why ? because whether a word be from a particular topic , actually depend on the document . can you see why ? well , it be through the pi . the pis be tie to each document . each document can have a potentially different pis , right ? the pis will then affect our prediction , so the pis be here , and this depend on the document .

That's why we spend some time to explain this in detail, but in particular there also very useful for discovering syntagmatic relations. In particular, mutual information is a principled way for discovering such a relation. It allows us to have values computer on different pairs of words that are comfortable, and so we can rank these pairs and discover the strongest cinematical relationship from collection of documents. Now note that there is some relation between syntactic medical relation discovery and paradigmatically relation discovery. So we already discussed the possibility of using BM 25 to achieve waiting for terms in the context to potentially also suggest the candidates that have seen like medical relations with the candidate word. But here, once we use mutual information to discover Syntagmatic relations, we can also represent the context with this mutual information as weights.	they be the same , so these three concept be actually very useful for other application as well . that be why we spend some time to explain this in detail , but in particular there also very useful for discover syntagmatic relation . in particular , mutual information be a principled way for discover such a relation . it allow we to have value computer on different pair of word that be comfortable , and so we can rank these pair and discover the strong cinematical relationship from collection of document . now note that there be some relation between syntactic medical relation discovery and paradigmatically relation discovery . so we already discuss the possibility of use BM 25 to achieve wait for term in the context to potentially also suggest the candidate that have see like medical relation with the candidate word . but here , once we use mutual information to discover syntagmatic relation , we can also represent the context with this mutual information as weight .

The sample is small, then if we trust data entirely and try to fit the data and then we will be biased. So in the case of text data, let's say our observed 100 words did not contain another word related to text mining, then our maximum likelihood estimator would give that word zero probability. Because giving a non zero probability would take away probability mass from some observed world which obviously is not optimal in terms of maximizing the likelihood of the observed data. But this zero probability for all the unseen words may not be reasonable sometimes, especially if we want the distribution to characterize the topic of text mining. So one way to address this problem is actually to use Bayesian estimation, where we actually would look at both the data and all our prior knowledge about the parameters. We assume that we have some prior belief about the parameters. Now in this case, of course, so we are.	but it have a problem when the datum be too small , because when the datum point be too small , there be very few data point . the sample be small , then if we trust datum entirely and try to fit the datum and then we will be bias . so in the case of text datum , let 's say our observed 100 word do not contain another word relate to text mining , then our maximum likelihood estimator would give that word zero probability . because give a non zero probability would take away probability mass from some observe world which obviously be not optimal in term of maximize the likelihood of the observed datum . but this zero probability for all the unseen word may not be reasonable sometimes , especially if we want the distribution to characterize the topic of text mining . so one way to address this problem be actually to use bayesian estimation , where we actually would look at both the datum and all our prior knowledge about the parameter . we assume that we have some prior belief about the parameter . now in this case , of course , so we be .

So I showed F of Theta here as an interesting variable that we want to compute. But in order to compute this value, we need to know the value of Theta. In Bayesian inference, we treat data as uncertain variable. So we think about all the possible values of Theta. Therefore we can estimate the value of this function F as the expected value of F according to the posterior distribution of data given the observed evidence X. As a special case, we can assume F of Theta is just equal to 0. In this case we get the expected value of Theta. That's basically the posterior mean that gives us also one point of Theta. And it's sometimes the same as posterior mode, but it's not always the same, so it gives us another way to estimate the parameters.	so the problem of bayesian inference be to infer this posterior distribution and also to infer other interesting quantity that might depend on Theta . so I show F of Theta here as an interesting variable that we want to compute . but in order to compute this value , we need to know the value of Theta . in Bayesian inference , we treat datum as uncertain variable . so we think about all the possible value of Theta . therefore we can estimate the value of this function F as the expect value of F accord to the posterior distribution of datum give the observe evidence X. as a special case , we can assume F of Theta be just equal to 0 . in this case we get the expect value of Theta . that be basically the posterior mean that give we also one point of Theta . and it be sometimes the same as posterior mode , but it be not always the same , so it give we another way to estimate the parameter .

An especially polarity analysis, very clear that order here and so these categories are not all that independent. There is order among them, and so it's useful to consider the order. For example, we could use ordinal regression to do, and that's something that will talk more about later. So now let's talk about some features that often very useful for text categorization and text mining in general, but some of them are especially also needed for sentiment analysis. So let's start from the simplest one, which is character n-grams. You can just have a sequence of characters as a unit, and they can be mixed with different n(s) and different lengths.	the other be to consider the order of these category . an especially polarity analysis , very clear that order here and so these category be not all that independent . there be order among they , and so it be useful to consider the order . for example , we could use ordinal regression to do , and that be something that will talk more about later . so now let 's talk about some feature that often very useful for text categorization and text mining in general , but some of they be especially also need for sentiment analysis . so let 's start from the simple one , which be character n - gram . you can just have a sequence of character as a unit , and they can be mix with different n(s ) and different length .

Uni Grams are actually often very effective for a lot of text processing tasks and that's mostly because words are well designed features by humans for communication, and so they often good enough for many tasks, but it's not good or not sufficient for sentiment analysis clearly. For example, we might see a sentence like it's not good or it's not as good as something else. So in such a case, if you just take a good and that would suggest positive, it's not good, so it's not accurate, but if you take the bigram, not good together, and then it's more accurate, so longer n-grams are generally more discriminative and they are more specific. If you match it and it says a lot and it's accurate. It's unlikely, very ambiguous.	so next we have word n - gram , a sequence of word and again we can mix they with different length .

An obviously that kind of classifier won't generalize to future data when such discriminating features will not necessarily occur. So that's a problem of overfitting. That's not desirable. We can also consider part of speech tag n-grams if we can do part of speech tagging and for example, adjective, noun could form a pair. We can also mix N grams of words and N grams of part of speech tags. For example, the word great might be followed by a non and this could become a feature, a hybrid feature.	but it may cause overfitting because with such very unique feature the machine learn program can easily pick up such feature from the training set and to rely on such unique feature to distinguish category . an obviously that kind of classifier wo n't generalize to future datum when such discriminate feature will not necessarily occur . so that be a problem of overfitting . that be not desirable . we can also consider part of speech tag n - gram if we can do part of speech tagging and for example , adjective , noun could form a pair . we can also mix n gram of word and n gram of part of speech tag . for example , the word great might be follow by a non and this could become a feature , a hybrid feature .

We can also learn word clusters empirically, for example we talk about mining associations of words and so we can have cluster of paradigmatically related words or sementically related words. And these clusters can be features to supplement the word based representation. Furthermore, we can also have frequent pattern syntax and these could be frequent word set.

So if we take a vote, then we'll conclude the object is actually of a different category. So this both illustrates how K nearest neighbor works and also illustrates some potential problems of this classifier. Basically the results might depend on the K and indeed K is an important parameter to optimize.	so in this case now we    be go to notice that among the four neighbor there be actually three neighbor in a different category . so if we take a vote , then we 'll conclude the object be actually of a different category . so this both illustrate how K near neighbor work and also illustrate some potential problem of this classifier . basically the result might depend on the k and indeed K be an important parameter to optimize .

But if we have only a few, then the decision may not be reliable. So on the one hand we want to find more neighbors right? And then we have more votes, but on the other hand as we try to find the more neighbors, we actually could risk on getting neighbors that are not really similar to this instance, they might be actually far away as you try to get more neighbors, so although you get more neighbors to vote, but those neighbors aren't necessary so helpful because they are not very similar to the object. So the parameter as there has to be set empirically and typically you can optimize such a parameter by using cross validation. Basically, you're going to separate your training data into two parts and then you're going to use one part to actually help you choose.

For example, probability of theta I given document D is locally smoothed and that just means we're going to assume that this probability is the same for all the documents in this region.

If our similarity function captures objects that do follow similar distributions, then this assumption is OK. But if our similarity function could not capture that. Obviously the assumption would be a problem, and then the classifier would not be accurate.	that be actually important assumption that would allow we to do a lot of machine learning , but in reality , whether this be true of course would depend on how we define similarity , because the neighborhood be largely determine by our similarity function . if our similarity function capture object that do follow similar distribution , then this assumption be ok . but if our similarity function could not capture that . obviously the assumption would be a problem , and then the classifier would not be accurate .

One is to extend the PLSA with prior knowledge that would allow us to have in some sense a user controlled PLSA, so it doesn't blindly just listen to data but also would listen to our needs. The second is to extend the PLSA as a generative model fully generated model.

We are going to just fit data as much as we can and get some insight about data. This is also very useful, but sometimes a user might have some expectations about which topics to analyze. For example, we might expect to see retrieval models as a topic in information retrieval. We also may be interested in certain aspects such as battery and memory when looking at the opinions about the laptop, because the user is particularly interested in these aspects.	the standard PLSA be go to blindly listen to the datum by use maximum likelihood estimator . we be go to just fit datum as much as we can and get some insight about datum . this be also very useful , but sometimes a user might have some expectation about which topic to analyze . for example , we might expect to see retrieval model as a topic in information retrieval . we also may be interested in certain aspect such as battery and memory when look at the opinion about the laptop , because the user be particularly interested in these aspect .

For example, we might have seen those tags topic tags assigned to documents. And those tag could be treated as topics if we do that, then a document that can only be generated using topics corresponding to the tags already assigned to the document. If the document is not assigned to a tag, we're going to say there's no way for using that topic to generate the document. The document must be generated by using the topics corresponding to the assigned tags. So the question is, how can we incorporate such knowledge into PLSA? It turns out that there's a. A very elegant way of doing that, and that's all incorporated such knowledge as priors on the models.	and we may know which topic be definitely not cover in which document or be cover in the document . for example , we might have see those tag topic tag assign to document . and those tag could be treat as topic if we do that , then a document that can only be generate use topic correspond to the tag already assign to the document . if the document be not assign to a tag , we be go to say there be no way for use that topic to generate the document . the document must be generate by use the topic correspond to the assign tag . so the question be , how can we incorporate such knowledge into PLSA ? it turn out that there be a. a very elegant way of do that , and that be all incorporate such knowledge as prior on the model .

Basically is to maximize the posterior distribution probability and this is a combination of the likelihood of data and the prior. So what would happen is that we're going to have an estimate that listens to the data and also listens to our prior preferences. We can use this prior, which is denoted as P of Lambda to encode. All kinds of preferences and constraints. So for example, we can use this to encode the need of having precisely 1 background the topic.	so in this case we can use maximum a posteriori estimate , also call map estimate , and the formula be give here . basically be to maximize the posterior distribution probability and this be a combination of the likelihood of datum and the prior . so what would happen be that we be go to have an estimate that listen to the datum and also listen to our prior preference . we can use this prior , which be denote as p of Lambda to encode . all kind of preference and constraint . so for example , we can use this to encode the need of have precisely 1 background the topic .

In other words, in other cases if it's not like that, we're going to say supplier says it's impossible. So the probability of that kind of model setting would be 0 according to our prior.	now this can be encode as a prior because we can say the prior for the parameter be only a non zero if the plan do contain one topic that be equivalent to the background language model . in other word , in other case if it be not like that , we be go to say supplier say it be impossible . so the probability of that kind of model setting would be 0 accord to our prior .

For example, we can force the document D to choose topic one with probability of 1/2.	so now we can also , for example use the prior to force particular choice of topic to have a probability of a certain number . for example , we can force the document d to choose topic one with probability of 1/2 .

In this case, we're not going to say it's impossible, but we're going to just strongly favor certain kind of distributions.	we can also use the prior to favor set of parameter with topic that assign high probability to some particular word . in this case , we be not go to say it be impossible , but we be go to just strongly favor certain kind of distribution .

The map can be computed using a similar EM algorithm as we have used for that maximum likelihood estimator with just some modification to smallest parameters reflect the prior preferences.	and you will see example later . the map can be compute use a similar em algorithm as we have use for that maximum likelihood estimator with just some modification to small parameter reflect the prior preference .

As a result, we can combine the two and the consequences that you can basically convert the influence of the prior into the influence of having additional pseudo data because the two functional forms are the same and they can be combined. So the effect is as if we had more data.	and in such a estimate , if we use a special form of the prior call conjugate prior , then the functional form of the prior will be similar to the datum . as a result , we can combine the two and the consequence that you can basically convert the influence of the prior into the influence of have additional pseudo datum because the two functional form be the same and they can be combine . so the effect be as if we have more datum .

Suppose the user is particularly interested in battery life of a laptop, and we're analyzing reviews. So the prior says that the distribution should contain one distribution that would assign high probabilities to battery, and life.	so now let 's look at the specific example . suppose the user be particularly interested in battery life of a laptop , and we be analyze review . so the prior say that the distribution should contain one distribution that would assign high probability to battery , and life .

Now if we use map estimator with the conjugated prior, which is Dirichlet prior Dirichlet distribution based on this preference, then the only difference in the EM algorithm is in the M step. When we re estimate word distributions, we are going to add. Additional counts to reflect our prior right? So here you can see the pseudocounts are defined the based on the probability of words in our prior. So battery obviously will have a high pseudocounts similar life would have also high pseudocounts or the other words. We have 0 pseudocounts because their probability is zero in the prior and when you see this is also controlled by a parameter mu and We're going to add mu multiplied by the probability of W given our prior distribution to the connected counts. When we re estimate the when we re estimate the this world distribution right? So this is the only step that changed and the changes happened here and before we just collect the counts of words that we believe have been generated from this topic. But now we force this distribution. To give more probabilities to these words by adding them to the pseudocounts so to artificially in effect, we artificially inflated their probabilities and to make this distribution we also need to add this many pseudocounts to the denominator. This is the total sum of all the pseudocounts we have added for all the words. This would make this again a distribution.	so we could do say there be a distribution that be entirely concentrated on battery life and we all prior be that one of your distribution should be very similar to this . now if we use map estimator with the conjugate prior , which be Dirichlet prior dirichlet distribution base on this preference , then the only difference in the EM algorithm be in the M step . when we re estimate word distribution , we be go to add . additional count to reflect our prior right ? so here you can see the pseudocount be define the base on the probability of word in our prior . so battery obviously will have a high pseudocount similar life would have also high pseudocount or the other word . we have 0 pseudocount because their probability be zero in the prior and when you see this be also control by a parameter mu and we be go to add mu multiply by the probability of w give our prior distribution to the connect count . when we re estimate the when we re estimate the this world distribution right ? so this be the only step that change and the change happen here and before we just collect the count of word that we believe have be generate from this topic . but now we force this distribution . to give more probability to these word by add they to the pseudocount so to artificially in effect , we artificially inflate their probability and to make this distribution we also need to add this many pseudocount to the denominator . this be the total sum of all the pseudocount we have add for all the word . this would make this again a distribution .

Think about what would happen if we set Mu to Zero. Well, that's essentially to remove this prior, so mu in some sense indicates our strength on prior.	it be useful to think about two specific extreme case of Mu . now can you picture . think about what would happen if we set Mu to Zero . well , that be essentially to remove this prior , so mu in some sense indicate our strength on prior .

Well, that's to say this price is so strong that we're not going to listen to the data at all. So in the end you can see in this case we can do make one distribution fixed to the prior. You see why? When mu is Infinity, we basically let this one dominate. In fact, we are going to set this one. to precise this distribution, so in this case it is this distribution, and that's why we said the background language model is in fact a way to enforce a prior, because with false one distribution to be exactly the same as what we give, that's the background distribution. So in this case we can even force the distribution to entirely focused on battery life. But of course this won't work well 'cause it cannot attract other words, it would affect the accuracy of counting. Topics about the battery life so in practice mu is set somewhere in between, of course.	now what would happen if we set Mu to positive Infinity ? well , that be to say this price be so strong that we be not go to listen to the datum at all . so in the end you can see in this case we can do make one distribution fix to the prior . you see why ? when mu be Infinity , we basically let this one dominate . in fact , we be go to set this one . to precise this distribution , so in this case it be this distribution , and that be why we say the background language model be in fact a way to enforce a prior , because with false one distribution to be exactly the same as what we give , that be the background distribution . so in this case we can even force the distribution to entirely focus on battery life . but of course this wo n't work well 'cause it can not attract other word , it would affect the accuracy of counting . topic about the battery life so in practice mu be set somewhere in between , of course .

For example, we can set any parameters for constraints, including zero as needed. For example, we may want to set one of the pis to 0.	so this be one way to impose our prior . we can also impose some other constraint . for example , we can set any parameter for constraint , include zero as need . for example , we may want to set one of the pis to 0 .

And this is no surprise at all, because after all we are maximizing the likelihood of the data. So all the more word occurs, then it's it makes more sense to give such a word a high probability because the impact would be more on the likelihood function. This is in fact a very general phenomenon of all the maximum likelihood estimator, but in this case we can see as we see more occurrences of term. It also encourages the unknown distribution theta sub d to assign somewhat higher probability to this word.	right , so this mean there be another behavior that we observe here that be high frequency word generally how high probability from all the distribution . and this be no surprise at all , because after all we be maximize the likelihood of the datum . so all the more word occur , then it be it make more sense to give such a word a high probability because the impact would be more on the likelihood function . this be in fact a very general phenomenon of all the maximum likelihood estimator , but in this case we can see as we see more occurrence of term . it also encourage the unknown distribution theta sub d to assign somewhat high probability to this word .

Now you will see these terms for the will have a different form where the probability of 'the' would be even larger because the background that has a high probability for the word  and the coefficient in front of point nine which is now 0.5 would be even larger. When this is larger the overall result would be larger and that also makes them less important for thetasub D to increase the probability for the because it's already very large so the impact here of increasing the probability of the is somewhat regulated by this coefficient 0.5. If it's a larger on the background then it becomes less important to increase the value so. So. This means the behavior here, which is high frequency words tend to get a higher probabilities are affected or regularised somewhat by the probability of choosing each component. The more likely a component that is being chosen, it's more important than to have higher values for these frequent words. If you have a very small probability of being chosen, than the incentive is less.	now , we 've be so far , assume that each model be equally likely and that give we 0.5 , but you can again look at this like your function and try to picture what would happen if we increase the probability of choose a background model . now you will see these term for the will have a different form where the probability of ' the ' would be even large because the background that have a high probability for the word    and the coefficient in front of point nine which be now 0.5 would be even large . when this be large the overall result would be large and that also make they less important for thetasub d to increase the probability for the because it be already very large so the impact here of increase the probability of the be somewhat regulate by this coefficient 0.5 . if it be a large on the background then it become less important to increase the value so . so . this mean the behavior here , which be high frequency word tend to get a high probability be affect or regularise somewhat by the probability of choose each component . the more likely a component that be be choose , it be more important than to have high value for these frequent word . if you have a very small probability of be choose , than the incentive be less .

And this is tocollaboratively maximize the likelihood. Second, different component models tend to bet high probabilities on different words, and this is to avoid competition or waste of probability, and this would allow them to collaborate more efficiently to maximize the likelihood.	so to summarize , we have just discuss the mixture model and we discuss the estimation problem of mixture model and in particular we discuss some general behavior of the estimate an that mean we can expect the our estimator to capture these intuition . 1st every component component model attempt to assign high probability to high frequency word in the datum . and this be tocollaboratively maximize the likelihood . second , different component model tend to bet high probability on different word , and this be to avoid competition or waste of probability , and this would allow they to collaborate more efficiently to maximize the likelihood .

So once we have a similarity function, we can then aim at optimally partitioning to partitioning the data into clusters or into different groups. Anne, try to maximize the intragroup similarity and minimize the intergroup similarity. That is, to ensure the objects that are put in the same group to be similar, but the objects that are put into different groups to be not similar, and these are the general goals of clustering. And there's often a tradeoff between achieving both goals. Now, there are many different methods for doing similarity based clustering. In general, I think we can distinguish two strategies at high level. One is to progressively construct the hierarchy of clusters.	the whole process be drive by optimize the likeable , but here we explicitly provide a review of what we think be similar , and this be often very useful because then it allow we to inject any particular view of similarity into the clustering program . so once we have a similarity function , we can then aim at optimally partition to partition the datum into cluster or into different group .

So one is bottom up that can be called agglomerative, where we gradually Group A similar object into larger and larger clusters until we group everything together. The other is top down or divisive. In this case we gradually partitioning the whole data set into smaller and smaller clusters. The other general strategy is to start with the initial tentative clustering and then iteratively improve it and this often leads to a flat clustering. One example is K means.	and so this often lead to hierarchical clustering an we can far distinguish two way to construct the hierarchy depend on whether we start with the collection to divide the collection or start with individual object and gradually group they together . so one be bottom up that can be call agglomerative , where we gradually Group a similar object into large and large cluster until we group everything together . the other be top down or divisive . in this case we gradually partition the whole datum set into small and small cluster . the other general strategy be to start with the initial tentative clustering and then iteratively improve it and this often lead to a flat clustering . one example be k mean .

And once we have these Central Eastside, we're going to assign a vector to the cluster hosts entry that is closest to the current vector. So basically we're going to measure the distance between this vector and each of the centroids, and see which one is closest to this one, and then just put this class this object into that cluster.

In this case, we're going to improve the clustering result iteratively by also doing 2 steps, and in fact the two steps are very similar to EM algorithm. In that when we allocate vector into one of the clusters based on our tentative clustering, it's very similar to inferring the distribution that has been used with generally the document in the mixture model. So it's essentially similar to eastep. Also, what's the difference? While the differences here, we don't make a probabilistic on location as in the case of the step. But rather we make a choice. We're going to make a call if this data point is closest to cluster two that were going to say you are in class too.

Now the next we're going to adjust the centroid, and this is very similar to M step where we re estimate the parameters. That's when we'll have a better estimate of the parameter. So here we have a better clustering result by adjusting the centroid. And note that the central is adjusted based on the average of the vectors in the. A cluster, so this is also similar to the M step, where we do counts pull together counter and normalize them, or the difference of course is also because of the difference in the instep, and we're not going to consider probabilities when we count the points in this case, for K means we're going to only count the objects allocated to this cluster, and this is only a subset of data points.

We have precision, P1 recall R1 and F value F1 and similarly we can do that for Category 2 and all the other categories. Once we compute that, then we can aggregate them. So for example, we can aggregate all the precision values for all the categories to compute the overall precision and this is often very useful. To summarize what we have seen in the whole data set and the aggregation can be done in many different ways. Again, as I said, in case one unit to aggregate different values. It's always good to think about what's the best way of doing the aggregation. For example, you can consider arithmetic mean, which is very commonly used. Or you can use geometric mean which would have different behavior depending on the way you aggregate. You might have got different conclusions.	again , for each category , we can compute the precision recall and F1 so for example , for category c one . we have precision , P1 recall R1 and F value F1 and similarly we can do that for category 2 and all the other category . once we compute that , then we can aggregate they . so for example , we can aggregate all the precision value for all the category to compute the overall precision and this be often very useful . to summarize what we have see in the whole datum set and the aggregation can be do in many different way . again , as I say , in case one unit to aggregate different value . it be always good to think about what be the good way of do the aggregation . for example , you can consider arithmetic mean , which be very commonly use . or you can use geometric mean which would have different behavior depend on the way you aggregate . you might have get different conclusion .

So the difference, for example between arithmetic mean and geometric mean is that the arithmetic mean would be dominated by high values, whereas geometric mean would be more affected by low values, and so whether you want to emphasize low values or high values would be a question related to your application.	in term of which method work well , so it be important to consider these difference and choose the right one or more suitable one for your task . so the difference , for example between arithmetic mean and geometric mean be that the arithmetic mean would be dominate by high value , whereas geometric mean would be more affect by low value , and so whether you want to emphasize low value or high value would be a question relate to your application .

So it's exactly the same situation for each document or computer precision. Recall and F.

Categorisation results are sometimes or often indeed passed to human for various purposes. For example, it might be passed to humans for further editing. For example, news articles can be tentatively categorized by using the system and then human editors would then correct them. And all the email messages might be routed to the right person for handling in the help desk, and in such a case the categorizations do help prioritizing the task for a particular customer service person. So in this case, the results have to be prioritized.	now this be because . categorisation result be sometimes or often indeed pass to human for various purpose . for example , it might be pass to human for far editing . for example , news article can be tentatively categorize by use the system and then human editor would then correct they . and all the email message might be route to the right person for handle in the help desk , and in such a case the categorization do help prioritize the task for a particular customer service person . so in this case , the result have to be prioritize .

So for example, discovery of spam emails can be evaluated, based on ranking emails for the spam category and this is useful if you want people to verify whether this is really spam, right? The person would then take the ranked list to check one by one and then verify whether this is indeed a spam. So to reflect the utility for humans in such a task, it's better to evaluate the ranking accuracy, and this is basically similar to search again. And in such a case, often the problem can be better formulated as a ranking problem instead of categorization problem. So for example, ranking documents in the search engine can also be framed as a binary categorization problem, distinguishing relevant documents that are useful to users from those that are not useful. But typically we frame this as a ranking problem and we evaluated as a ranked list. That's be cause people tend to examine the results sequentially, so ranking evaluation more reflects the utility from users perspective.	and if the system can give a score to the categorisation decision or confidence , then we can use the score to rank these decision and then evaluate the result as a rank list , just as in search engine evaluation , where you rank the document in response to the query . so for example , discovery of spam email can be evaluate , base on rank email for the spam category and this be useful if you want people to verify whether this be really spam , right ? the person would then take the rank list to check one by one and then verify whether this be indeed a spam . so to reflect the utility for human in such a task , it be well to evaluate the ranking accuracy , and this be basically similar to search again . and in such a case , often the problem can be well formulate as a ranking problem instead of categorization problem . so for example , rank document in the search engine can also be frame as a binary categorization problem , distinguish relevant document that be useful to user from those that be not useful . but typically we frame this as a ranking problem and we evaluate as a rank list . that be be cause people tend to examine the result sequentially , so ranking evaluation more reflect the utility from user perspective .

So the problem of text categorization is actually very similar to document clustering in that we assume that each document belongs to one category or one cluster. Main difference is that in clustering we don't really know what are the predefined categories or what are the clusters. In fact, that's the goal of text clustering.

Or we can understand how we can use generative models to do text categorization from the perspective of clustering. And so this is a slide that we've talked about before about text clustering, where we assume there are multiple topics represented by word distributions. Each topic is 1 cluster.

So let me state the problem again, so let's just think about category One. We know there is one word distribution that has been used to generate documents. And we generated each word in the document independently and we know that we have observed the set of N sub one documents in the set of T1. These documents have been all generated from category one, namely have been all generated using this same word distribution. Now the question is what will be your guess or estimate of the probability of each word in this distribution and what will be your guess of the prior probability of this category? Of course, this second probability depends on how likely that you will see documents in other categories.	now , if you have n't think about that this problem , have n't see    naive Bayes classifier , it would be very useful for you to pause the video for a moment and to think about how to solve this problem . so let I state the problem again , so let 's just think about category one . we know there be one word distribution that have be use to generate document . and we generate each word in the document independently and we know that we have observe the set of N sub one document in the set of T1 . these document have be all generate from category one , namely have be all generate use this same word distribution . now the question be what will be your guess or estimate of the probability of each word in this distribution and what will be your guess of the prior probability of this category ? of course , this second probability depend on how likely that you will see document in other category .

First, what's the basis for estimating the prior or the probability of each category? Well, this has to do with whether you have observed a lot of documents from that category.

Well, the same and you'll be just assuming that words that are observed frequently in the documents that are known to be generated from a category. will likely have higher probability, and that's just the maximum likelihood estimator indeed, and that's what we could do. So to estimate the probability of each category. And to answer the question which category is most popular, then we can simply normalize the count of documents in each category. So here you see n sub I denotes the number of documents in each category.	and what about the basis for estimate the probability of word in each category ? well , the same and you 'll be just assume that word that be observe frequently in the document that be know to be generate from a category . will likely have high probability , and that be just the maximum likelihood estimator indeed , and that be what we could do . so to estimate the probability of each category . and to answer the question which category be most popular , then we can simply normalize the count of document in each category . so here you see n sub I denote the number of document in each category .

This time we can do this for each category. So let's say we are considering category I or Theta i I. So which word has higher probability? Well, we simply count the word occurrences in the documents that are known to be generated from theta i.	now , what about the word distribution ? well , we do the same again . this time we can do this for each category . so let 's say we be consider category I or Theta I I.

There is another issue in Naive Bayes which is a smoothing. In fact the smoothing is a general problem in all the estimate of language models and this has to do with what would happen if you have observed a small amount of data. So smoothing is the important technique to address data sparseness. In our case the training data set can be small and one data set is small. When we use maximum likelihood estimator we often face the problem of zero probability. That means if the event is not observed. Then the estimated probability would be 0 in this case if we have not seen a word in the training documents for, let's say, category I, then our estimate would be 0 for the probability of this word in this category. And this is generally not accurate. So we have to do smoothing to make sure it's not zero probability.	so once you figure out the answer to this question and you will know how to normalize , this count and so this be a good exercise to work on it if it be not obvious to you . there be another issue in Naive Bayes which be a smoothing . in fact the smoothing be a general problem in all the estimate of language model and this have to do with what would happen if you have observe a small amount of datum . so smoothing be the important technique to address datum sparseness . in our case the training datum set can be small and one datum set be small . when we use maximum likelihood estimator we often face the problem of zero probability . that mean if the event be not observe . then the estimate probability would be 0 in this case if we have not see a word in the training document for , let 's say , category I , then our estimate would be 0 for the probability of this word in this category . and this be generally not accurate . so we have to do smoothing to make sure it be not zero probability .

When the data set is small, we tend to rely on some prior knowledge to to solve the problem. So in this case our prior knowledge says that no words should have zero probability, so smoothing allows us to inject this prior to make sure that no word has a zero probability.	the other reason for smoothing be that this be a way to bring prior knowledge , and this be also generally true for a lot of situation of smoothing . when the data set be small , we tend to rely on some prior knowledge to to solve the problem . so in this case our prior knowledge say that no word should have zero probability , so smoothing allow we to inject this prior to make sure that no word have a zero probability .

We pretend that every category has actually some extra number of documents represented by Delta. And in the denominator we also add K multiplied by Delta because we want the probability to sum to one. So in total we've added Delta K Times because we have K categories. Therefore in the sum we have to also add K multiplied by Delta as a total pseudo counts that we add to the estimate.	so one possible way of smooth the probability of category be to simply add small nonnegative constant Delta to the count . we pretend that every category have actually some extra number of document represent by Delta . and in the denominator we also add K multiply by Delta because we want the probability to sum to one . so in total we 've add Delta K Times because we have k category . therefore in the sum we have to also add K multiply by Delta as a total pseudo count that we add to the estimate .

Obvious Delta is a smoothing parameter here, meaning that the larger delta is and the more we will do smoothing and that means we'll more rely on pseudo counts and we might indeed ignore the actual counts if delta is set to Infinity. Imagine what would happen if delta approaches positive Infinity? Well, we're going to say every word has infinity amount of sorry, not every word every category has. infinity amount of documents, and then there's no distinction between them, so it becomes just a uniform.	now it be interesting to think about the influence of delta .

Well we just go back to the original estimate based on the observed training data to estimate the probability of each category. Now we can do the same for the word distribution, but in this case we sometimes we find it useful to use a non-uniform pseudo counts for the words. So here you see we'll add pseudocounts to each word and that's mu multiplied by the probability of the world given by a background language model.	what if Delta be zero ? well we just go back to the original estimate base on the observed training datum to estimate the probability of each category . now we can do the same for the word distribution , but in this case we sometimes we find it useful to use a non - uniform pseudo count for the word . so here you see we 'll add pseudocount to each word and that be mu multiply by the probability of the world give by a background language model .

So what are those words? Well those are the common words. Because they get higher probability by the background language model so the pseudocounts added for such words would be higher, rare words on the other hand will have smaller pseudocounts.	now if we use such a background language model to add pseudocount , we find that some word will receive more pseudocount . so what be those word ? well those be the common word . because they get high probability by the background language model so the pseudocount add for such word would be high , rare word on the other hand will have small pseudocount .

Therefore it's no longer so important that each category has documents that contain such a lot of occurrences of such word, or the estimate is more influenced by the background model and the consequences that when we do categorization, such words tend not to influence the decision that much as words that have small probabilities. From the background language model, those words don't get some help from the background language model, so the difference would be primarily because of the differences of the occurrences in the training documents in different categories.	because every category have some help from their background for word , like the , a which have high probability . therefore it be no long so important that each category have document that contain such a lot of occurrence of such word , or the estimate be more influence by the background model and the consequence that when we do categorization , such word tend not to influence the decision that much as word that have small probability . from the background language model , those word do n't get some help from the background language model , so the difference would be primarily because of the difference of the occurrence in the training document in different category .

There are some interesting special cases to think about as well. First, let's think about when mu approaches Infinity. What would happen?

So to solve these problems intuitively we need to use more words to describe the topic and this would address the problem of lack of expressive power. When we have more words that we can use to describe the topic, we can describe complicated topics, to address the second problem, we need to introduce weights of words. This would allow you to distinguish subtle differences in topics and to introduce semantically related words in the fuzzy manner. Finally, to solve the problem of word ambiguity, we need to split an ambiguous word so that we can disambiguate its topic.	so this be a slide that you have see early where we discuss the problem with use a term as a topic . so to solve these problem intuitively we need to use more word to describe the topic and this would address the problem of lack of expressive power . when we have more word that we can use to describe the topic , we can describe complicated topic , to address the second problem , we need to introduce weight of word . this would allow you to distinguish subtle difference in topic and to introduce semantically relate word in the fuzzy manner . finally , to solve the problem of word ambiguity , we need to split an ambiguous word so that we can disambiguate its topic .

In this case I marked them in black so "you can see ""travel""," for example, occured in all the three topics here, but with different probabilities.	now you can also see there be some word that be share by these topic . well , when I say share , that just mean even with some probability threshold you can still see one word to occur in multiple topic . in this case I mark they in black so " you can see " " travel " " , " for example , occur in all the three topic here , but with different probability .

So with this representation is addresses the three problems that mentioned earlier. First, it now uses multiple words that describe topic, so it allows us to describe fairly complicated topics. Second, it assigns weights to terms, so now we can model several differences of semantics and you can bring in related words together to model topic. Third, because we have probabilities for the same word in different topics. We can disambiguate the sense of word in the text to decode its underlying topic, so we address all these three problems with this new way of representing a topic. So now, of course, our problem definition has been refined just slightly. The slide is very similar to what you have seen before, except that we have added refinement for what the topic is. So now each topic is word distribution.

So you see a constraint here and we still have another constraint on the topic coverage, namely pis. So all the pis of IGS must sum to one for the same document.	and for each word distribution , we know that all the probability should sum to one over all the word in the vocabulary . so you see a constraint here and we still have another constraint on the topic coverage , namely pis . so all the pis of IGS must sum to one for the same document .

So we clearly specify the input and output as illustrated here on this side. The input, of course is our text data C is the collection, but we also generally assume we know the number of topics K or we hypothesize a number and then try to mine K topics, even though we don't know the exact topics that exist in the collection and these vocabulary set. As a set of words that determines what units would be treated as the basic units for analysis. In most cases, we use words as the basis.	so how do we solve this problem ? well , let 's look at this problem as a computation problem now . so we clearly specify the input and output as illustrate here on this side . the input , of course be our text datum c be the collection , but we also generally assume we know the number of topic k or we hypothesize a number and then try to mine K topic , even though we do n't know the exact topic that exist in the collection and these vocabulary set . as a set of word that determine what unit would be treat as the basic unit for analysis . in most case , we use word as the basis .

So given a set of text data, we would like to compute all these distributions and all these coverages, as you have seen on this slide.	we also want to know the coverage of topic in each document so that that be the same pi_ij 's that we have see before . so give a set of text datum , we would like to compute all these distribution and all these coverage , as you have see on this slide .

Indeed, you can write a heuristic program to solve this problem, but here we're going to introduce a general way of solving this problem called generative model, and this is in fact very general idea, and it's a principle way of using statistical modeling to solve text mining problems, and here I dim the picture that you have seen before in order to show the generation process.	now of course , there may be many different way of solve this problem . indeed , you can write a heuristic program to solve this problem , but here we be go to introduce a general way of solve this problem call generative model , and this be in fact very general idea , and it be a principle way of use statistical modeling to solve text mining problem , and here I dim the picture that you have see before in order to show the generation process .

So we design a probabilistic model to model how the data are generated. Of course this is based on our assumption. The actual data aren't necessary generating this way, so that would give us a probability distribution of the data that you are seeing on this slide given a particular model and parameters that are denoted by Lambda. So this capital lambda actually consists of all the parameters that we're interested in. And these parameters in general, we control the behavior of the probabilistic model, meaning that if you set these parameters for different values, it will give some data points higher probabilities than others. Now in this case, of course, for our tax mining problem, or more precisely topic mining problem, we have the following parameters. First, we have theta_i's Each is a word distribution and then we have a set of pi's for each document. And since we have N documents so we have N sets of pis.	so the idea of this approach be actually to 1st design a model for our datum . so we design a probabilistic model to model how the datum be generate . of course this be base on our assumption . the actual datum be n't necessary generate this way , so that would give we a probability distribution of the datum that you be see on this slide give a particular model and parameter that be denote by Lambda . so this capital lambda actually consist of all the parameter that we be interested in . and these parameter in general , we control the behavior of the probabilistic model , mean that if you set these parameter for different value , it will give some datum point high probability than other . now in this case , of course , for our tax mining problem , or more precisely topic mining problem , we have the follow parameter . first , we have theta_i 's each be a word distribution and then we have a set of pi 's for each document . and since we have n document so we have n set of pis .

So this is to say that we first pretend we already have these word distributions and coverage numbers, and then we're going to see how we can generate data by using such distributions. So how do we model the data in this way? And we assume that data are actually samples drawn from such a model that depends on these parameters. Now one interesting question here is to think about how many parameters are there in total. Now obviously we can already see N * K parameters for pi's. We also see K theta_i's, but each theta_i is actually a set of probability values. Right? it's a distribution over words.	and each set of the pi value will sum to one . so this be to say that we first pretend we already have these word distribution and coverage number , and then we be go to see how we can generate datum by use such distribution . so how do we model the datum in this way ? and we assume that datum be actually sample draw from such a model that depend on these parameter . now one interesting question here be to think about how many parameter be there in total . now obviously we can already see N * k parameter for pi 's . we also see K theta_i 's , but each theta_i be actually a set of probability value . right ? it be a distribution over word .

In other words, we would like to adjust these parameter values until we give our data set the maximum probability.	now , once we set up with a model , then we can fit the model to our datum , mean that we can estimate the parameter or infer the parameter base on the datum . in other word , we would like to adjust these parameter value until we give our datum set the maximum probability .

What we're interested in here is what parameter values will give our data set the highest probability. So I also illustrate the problem with the picture that you see here. On the X axis, I just illustrate the Lambda, the parameters as one dimensional variable. It's oversimplification obviously, but it suffices is to show the idea and the Y axis shows the probability of the data observed this probability obviously depends on the setting of Lambda, so that's why it varies as you change the value of Lambda. What we're interested in here is to find the Lambda star that would maximize the probability of the observed data.	I just say that depend on the parameter value , some data point will have high probability than other . what we be interested in here be what parameter value will give our datum set the high probability . so I also illustrate the problem with the picture that you see here . on the x axis , I just illustrate the Lambda , the parameter as one dimensional variable . it be oversimplification obviously , but it suffice be to show the idea and the Y axis show the probability of the datum observe this probability obviously depend on the setting of Lambda , so that be why it vary as you change the value of Lambda . what we be interested in here be to find the Lambda star that would maximize the probability of the observed datum .

So this is a general idea of using a generative model for text mining. First we design a model with some parameters that we are interested in, and then we model the data. We adjust the parameters to fit the data as well as we can. After we have fitted data then we will recover some parameter values will get this specific parameter values and those would be the output of the algorithm and we treat those as actually the discovered knowledge from text data. By varying the model, of course we can discover different knowledge. So to summarize, we introduced a new way of representing a topic, namely represented as word distribution, and this has advantage of using multiple words to describe a complicated topic.	so this would be then our estimate of the parameter and these parameter note that be precisely what we hope to discover from text datum , so would treat these parameter as actually the outcome or the output of the datum mining algorithm . so this be a general idea of use a generative model for text mining . first we design a model with some parameter that we be interested in , and then we model the datum . we adjust the parameter to fit the datum as well as we can . after we have fit datum then we will recover some parameter value will get this specific parameter value and those would be the output of the algorithm and we treat those as actually the discover knowledge from text datum . by vary the model , of course we can discover different knowledge . so to summarize , we introduce a new way of represent a topic , namely represent as word distribution , and this have advantage of use multiple word to describe a complicate topic .

We talked about the task of topic mining and analysis when we define a topic as a distribution, so the input is a collection of text articles. The number of topics and vocabulary set and the output is a set of topics. Each is word distribution.	it also allow we to assign weight on word so we can model subtle variation of semantic . we talk about the task of topic mining and analysis when we define a topic as a distribution , so the input be a collection of text article . the number of topic and vocabulary set and the output be a set of topic . each be word distribution .

The first is the constraints on the word distributions. In each world distribution, the probabilities on all the words must sum to one over all the words in the vocabulary. The second constraint is on the topic coverage in each document. A document is not allowed to cover a topic outside the set of topics that we are discovering. So the coverage of each of these K topics would sum to one for a document. We also introduce the general idea of using a generative model for text mining and the idea here is to first design a model to model the generation of data. We simply assume that they are generated this way and inside the model we embed some parameters that were interested in denoted by Lambda.	and also the coverage of all the topic in each document and these be formally represent by theta_i 's and pi_i 's an we have two constraint here for these parameter . the first be the constraint on the word distribution . in each world distribution , the probability on all the word must sum to one over all the word in the vocabulary . the second constraint be on the topic coverage in each document . a document be not allow to cover a topic outside the set of topic that we be discover . so the coverage of each of these K topic would sum to one for a document . we also introduce the general idea of use a generative model for text mining and the idea here be to first design a model to model the generation of datum . we simply assume that they be generate this way and inside the model we embed some parameter that be interested in denote by Lambda .

Now I've again she want lying here that can separate the two classes. And this line, of course, is determined by the vector beta, the coefficients, different coefficient will give us a different line. So we could imagine there are other lines that can do the same job. So gamma, for example, could give us another line that can also separate these instances.	so now the natural question be , which linear separate be the good ? now I 've again she want lie here that can separate the two class . and this line , of course , be determine by the vector beta , the coefficient , different coefficient will give we a different line . so we could imagine there be other line that can do the same job . so gamma , for example , could give we another line that can also separate these instance .

So that just means if Yi, the known label, for instance XI is one we would like this classify value to be large. And here we just choose threshold one here. But if you use another threshold, you can see you can easily affect that constant into the parameter values B&W to make the right hand side.

This is equivalent to the other inequality, so this one actually captures both constraints in a unified way, and that's a convenient way of capturing these constraints. What's our second goal? That's true. Maximizing margin, right? So we want to ensure the separate can do well on the training data, but then, among all the cases where we can separate the data, we also would like to choose the separate that has the largest margin. Now the margin can be shown to be related to the magnitude of the weights.	but when Yi be negative one you also see a new . this be equivalent to the other inequality , so this one actually capture both constraint in a unified way , and that be a convenient way of capture these constraint . what be our second goal ? that be true . maximize margin , right ? so we want to ensure the separate can do well on the training datum , but then , among all the case where we can separate the datum , we also would like to choose the separate that have the large margin . now the margin can be show to be relate to the magnitude of the weight .

We have some variables to optimize and these are the weights and B and we have some constraints. These are linear constraints and the objective function is a quadratic function of the weights. So this is a quadratic program with linear constraints and there are standard algorithms that are available for solving this problem. And once we solve, the problem, will obtain the weights W&B and then this would give us a well defined the classifier, so we can then use this classifier to classify any new texture objects. Now the previous formulation did not allow any error in the classification, but sometimes the data may not be linearly separable. That means they may not look as nice as you have seen on the previous slide where align can separate all of them. And what would happen if we. Allow some errors. The principle can stay right, so we want to minimize the training error, but try to also maximize the margin. But in this case we have a soft margin because the data points may not be a completely separate bowl. So it turns out that we can easily modify it as VM to accommodate this.	so now you can see this be basically optimization problem , right ? we have some variable to optimize and these be the weight and b and we have some constraint . these be linear constraint and the objective function be a quadratic function of the weight . so this be a quadratic program with linear constraint and there be standard algorithm that be available for solve this problem . and once we solve , the problem , will obtain the weight W&B and then this would give we a well define the classifier , so we can then use this classifier to classify any new texture object . now the previous formulation do not allow any error in the classification , but sometimes the datum may not be linearly separable . that mean they may not look as nice as you have see on the previous slide where align can separate all of they . and what would happen if we . allow some error . the principle can stay right , so we want to minimize the training error , but try to also maximize the margin . but in this case we have a soft margin because the data point may not be a completely separate bowl . so it turn out that we can easily modify it as VM to accommodate this .

So in our case actually it's easy to see the mixture model can be used for both text clustering and categorisation, so even imagine if you have a lot of unable text data for categorization then you can actually do clustering on these text data to learn categories. And then try to somehow align these categories with the categories defined by the training data where we already know which documents are in which category. So you can in fact use the EM algorithm to actually combine both. That would allow you essentially to also pick up a useful words in the unlabeled data. You can think of this in another way. Basically, we can use, let's say a naive Bayes classifier to classify all the unlabeled text documents. And then we're going to assume the high confidence classification results, or actually reliable. Then you certainly have more training data. The cause from the unlabeled data we some are labeled as category ones and more labeled as category two. Although the label is not completely reliable. But then they can still be useful. So let's assume they are actually training label examples and then we combine them with the true training examples. To improve categorization method and so this idea is very powerful and when the enable data and training data are very different and we might need to use other advanced machine learning techniques called domain adaptation or transfer learning, this is when we can borrow some training examples from a related problem that may be different or from a categorisation task that.	another idea be really exploit unable datum and there be technique call a semi supervised machine learn technique that can allow you to combine label datum with unlabeled datum . so in our case actually it be easy to see the mixture model can be use for both text clustering and categorisation , so even imagine if you have a lot of unable text datum for categorization then you can actually do clustering on these text datum to learn category . and then try to somehow align these category with the category define by the training datum where we already know which document be in which category . so you can in fact use the EM algorithm to actually combine both . that would allow you essentially to also pick up a useful word in the unlabeled datum . you can think of this in another way . basically , we can use , let 's say a naive Bayes classifier to classify all the unlabeled text document . and then we be go to assume the high confidence classification result , or actually reliable . then you certainly have more training datum . the cause from the unlabeled datum we some be label as category one and more label as category two . although the label be not completely reliable . but then they can still be useful . so let 's assume they be actually train label example and then we combine they with the true training example . to improve categorization method and so this idea be very powerful and when the enable datum and training datum be very different and we might need to use other advanced machine learn technique call domain adaptation or transfer learning , this be when we can borrow some training example from a relate problem that may be different or from a categorisation task that .

Of course, in this case these documents are independent and these topics also independent. But we can further allow these documents share topics and then. We can also assume that we are going to assume there are fewer topics. The number of documents.

It's just a small modification of the previous set up where we have just one distribution. Since we now have two distributions, we have to decide which distribution to use when we generate the word, but each word will still be sampled from one of the two distributions, right? So text data is still generating the same way. Namely, we're going to generate a one word at each time. An eventually we generated a lot of words. When we generate the word, however, we're going to 1st decide which of the two distributions to use, and this is controlled by another probability. Probability of theta sub D and probability of theta sub B here.	so how do this work ? it be just a small modification of the previous set up where we have just one distribution . since we now have two distribution , we have to decide which distribution to use when we generate the word , but each word will still be sample from one of the two distribution , right ? so text datum be still generate the same way . namely , we be go to generate a one word at each time . an eventually we generate a lot of word . when we generate the word , however , we be go to 1st decide which of the two distribution to use , and this be control by another probability . probability of theta sub d and probability of theta sub b here .

So if you can do basically flip a coin a fair coin to decide which one to use. But in general these probabilities don't have to be equal, so you might bias towards using one topic more than the other. So now the process of generating a word would be the first to flip a coin based on these probabilities of choosing each model and if. Let's say the coin shows up as head, which means we're going to use the topic world distribution. Then we're going to use this word distribution to generator a word. Otherwise we might be going through this path.	now in this case I just give example where we can set both to .5 . so if you can do basically flip a coin a fair coin to decide which one to use . but in general these probability do n't have to be equal , so you might bias towards use one topic more than the other . so now the process of generate a word would be the first to flip a coin base on these probability of choose each model and if . let 's say the coin show up as head , which mean we be go to use the topic world distribution . then we be go to use this word distribution to generator a word . otherwise we might be go through this path .

Now here I showed some words like the "and ""text"", so as in all cases, once we" set up the model, we're interested in computing the likelihood function. The basic question is, so what's the probability of observing a specific word here? Now we know that the word can be observed from each of the two distributions, so we have to consider 2 cases.

Well, in general we can use some observed text data to estimate the model parameters and this mission would allow us to discover the interesting knowledge about the text, so in this case, what do we discover?

That is, we don't have to use the raw frequency count of term to represent the context. We can transform it into some form that wouldn't emphasize so much on the raw frequency. To address the second problem, we can put more weight on rare terms. That is, we can reward matching a rare word and this heuristic is called IDF term weighting in text retrieval. IDF stands for inverse document frequency.	so to address the first problem , we can use a sub linear transformation of term frequency . that is , we do n't have to use the raw frequency count of term to represent the context . we can transform it into some form that would n't emphasize so much on the raw frequency . to address the second problem , we can put more weight on rare term . that is , we can reward match a rare word and this heuristic be call IDF term weight in text retrieval .

Now in general there are many ways to map that, and let's first look at the simple way of mapping. In this case, we're going to say, any non zero counts will be mapped to one.	and so that will be denote by TF of W&D as show in the Y axis . now in general there be many way to map that , and let 's first look at the simple way of mapping . in this case , we be go to say , any non zero count will be map to one .

So with this mapping, all the frequencies will be mapped to only two values, zero or one, and the mapping function is shown here as a flat line here. Now this is naive because it ignored the frequency of words. However, this actually has the advantage of emphasizing matching all the words in the context, so it does not allow a frequent word to dominate the matching. Now the approach that we have taken earlier in the expected overlap account approach is a linear transformation. We basically take Y as the same as X. So we use the raw count as representation.	and then zero count will be map to 0 . so with this mapping , all the frequency will be map to only two value , zero or one , and the mapping function be show here as a flat line here . now this be naive because it ignore the frequency of word . however , this actually have the advantage of emphasize match all the word in the context , so it do not allow a frequent word to dominate the matching . now the approach that we have take early in the expect overlap account approach be a linear transformation . we basically take Y as the same as X. so we use the raw count as representation .

This data generally will help us improve the prediction accuracy and in this loop are humans will recognize what additional data needs to be collected and machines would of course help humans identify what data should be collected next. In general, we want to collect data that are most useful for learning. And this there is actually a subarea in machine learning called active learning that has to do with this. How do you identify data points? That would be most helpful for machine learning programs if you can label them, right. So in general, you can see there's a loop here from data acquisition to data analysis or data mining to prediction of values, and to take actions to change the world and then observe what happens. And then you can then decide what additional data. Have to be collected by adjusting the snsor or from the prediction errors. you can also know what additional data we need to acquire in order to improve the accuracy of prediction. And this big picture is actually very general and it's reflecting a lot of important applications of big data.	so that be why I call this datum mining loop because as we perturb the sensor to collect the new datum and more useful datum then we will obtain more datum for prediction . this datum generally will help we improve the prediction accuracy and in this loop be human will recognize what additional datum need to be collect and machine would of course help human identify what datum should be collect next . in general , we want to collect datum that be most useful for learn . and this there be actually a subarea in machine learning call active learning that have to do with this . how do you identify data point ? that would be most helpful for machine learning program if you can label they , right . so in general , you can see there be a loop here from datum acquisition to datum analysis or datum mining to prediction of value , and to take action to change the world and then observe what happen . and then you can then decide what additional datum . have to be collect by adjust the snsor or from the prediction error . you can also know what additional datum we need to acquire in order to improve the accuracy of prediction . and this big picture be actually very general and it be reflect a lot of important application of big datum .

And this is most useful for prediction about human behavior or human preferences or opinions. But in general text data will be put together with non text data. So the interesting questions here would be first how can we design effective predictors? And how do we generate such effective predictors from text?	so from text mining perspective and we be interested in text base prediction , of course sometimes text alone can make prediction . and this be most useful for prediction about human behavior or human preference or opinion . but in general text datum will be put together with non text datum . so the interesting question here would be first how can we design effective predictor ? and how do we generate such effective predictor from text ?

This question has been addressed to some extent in some previous lectures where we talked about what kind of features we can design for text data. It has also been addressed to some extent by talking about the other knowledge that we can mine from text. So for example, topic mining can be very useful to generate the patterns or topic based indicators or predictors that can be further fed into a predictive model. So topics can be intermediate representation of text. That would allow us to design high level features or predictors that are useful for prediction of some other variable. It maybe, although it's generated from original text data, it provides a much better representation of the problem and it serves as more effective predictors.	... this question have be address to some extent in some previous lecture where we talk about what kind of feature we can design for text datum . it have also be address to some extent by talk about the other knowledge that we can mine from text . so for example , topic mining can be very useful to generate the pattern or topic base indicator or predictor that can be far feed into a predictive model . so topic can be intermediate representation of text . that would allow we to design high level feature or predictor that be useful for prediction of some other variable . it maybe , although it be generate from original text datum , it provide a much well representation of the problem and it serve as more effective predictor .

Now this is a question that we have not addressed yet. So in this lecture and the following lectures were going to address this problem because this is where we can generate the much more enriched features for prediction and allows us to review a lot of interesting knowledge about the world.

And then Secondly the human experts also need to provide a set of features to represent each text object that can potentially provide a clue about the category. So we need to provide some basic features for the computers to look into. And in the case of text, natural choice would be the words. So using each word as a feature is a very common choice to start with. But of course there are other sophisticated features like a phrases or even policy feature tags or even syntactic structures. So once human experts can provide this, then we can use machine learning to learn soft rules for categorization from the training data. So soft rules just means we're going to still decide which category should be assigned to the document. But it's not going to be used using a rule that is deterministic, so we might use something similar to saying that if it matches game sports many times, it's likely to be a sports. But we're not going to say exactly for sure, but instead we're going to use probabilities or weights so that we can combine multiple evidences, so the learning process basically is going to figure out which features are most useful for separating different categories.	and this be call a training datum . and then secondly the human expert also need to provide a set of feature to represent each text object that can potentially provide a clue about the category . so we need to provide some basic feature for the computer to look into . and in the case of text , natural choice would be the word . so use each word as a feature be a very common choice to start with . but of course there be other sophisticated feature like a phrase or even policy feature tag or even syntactic structure . so once human expert can provide this , then we can use machine learn to learn soft rule for categorization from the training datum . so soft rule just mean we be go to still decide which category should be assign to the document . but it be not go to be use use a rule that be deterministic , so we might use something similar to say that if it match game sport many time , it be likely to be a sport . but we be not go to say exactly for sure , but instead we be go to use probability or weight so that we can combine multiple evidence , so the learning process basically be go to figure out which feature be most useful for separate different category .

It's the basis for learning. And then the train classifier can be applied to a new text object to predict the most likely category, and that's to simulate the prediction of what a human would assign to this text object.

Finally, if you look at the picture to the left side of this picture, then you can see we can certainly also say something about the real world, right?

It might still be very expensive if the reviewer cares a lot about service, right? For this kind of service, this price is good, so the reviewer might give it a five star. But if reviewer really cares about the value of the hotel, then the five star most likely would mean really cheaper prices. So in order to interpret the ratings on different aspects accurately, we also need to know these aspect weights. When they are combined together, we can have a more detailed understanding of the opinion.

For example, in news we might favor title words. Actually, in general, we might want to favor title words becauses the authors tend to use the title to describe the topic of an article. If we're dealing with tweets, we could also favor hashtags which are invented to denote topics so naturally hashtags can be good candidates for representing topics. Anyway, after we have designed the scoring function, then we can discover the K topical terms by simply picking K terms with the highest scores. Now of course we might encounter a situation where the highest scored terms are all very similar. They are semantically similar or closely related or even synonyms. So that's not desirable, so we also want to have coverage over all the content in the collection. So we would like to remove redundancy and one way to do that is to do a greedy algorithm, which is sometimes called maximal marginal relevance ranking.	but when we apply such an approach to a particular problem , we might also be able to leverage some domain specific heuristic . for example , in news we might favor title word . actually , in general , we might want to favor title word because the author tend to use the title to describe the topic of an article . if we be deal with tweet , we could also favor hashtag which be invent to denote topic so naturally hashtag can be good candidate for represent topic . anyway , after we have design the scoring function , then we can discover the k topical term by simply pick K term with the high score . now of course we might encounter a situation where the high score term be all very similar . they be semantically similar or closely related or even synonym . so that be not desirable , so we also want to have coverage over all the content in the collection . so we would like to remove redundancy and one way to do that be to do a greedy algorithm , which be sometimes call maximal marginal relevance ranking .

With some thresholding then we can get balance of redundancy removal and also high score over term.

Second, it's incomplete in vocabulary coverage, meaning that the topic itself is only represented as one term. It does not suggest what other terms are related to the topic, even if we're talking about the sports, there are many terms that are related, so it does not allow us to easily count related terms toward contributing to coverage of this topic.

Sometimes this is useful as we might want to capture similarity based on general content that would give us loosely related paradigmatic relations, whereas if you use only the words immediately to the left and to the right of the world, then you likely will capture words that are very much related by their syntactical categories, or an semantics.	and this flexibility also allow we to measure the similarity similarity in some other different way . sometimes this be useful as we might want to capture similarity base on general content that would give we loosely relate paradigmatic relation , whereas if you use only the word immediately to the left and to the right of the world , then you likely will capture word that be very much relate by their syntactical category , or an semantic .

In general, we can combine all kinds of views of the context and so the similarity function is in general combination of similarities on different contexts. And of course we can also assign weights to these different similarities to allow us to focus more on particular kind of context, and this would be naturally application specific, but again here that main idea for discovering paradigmatically related words is to compute the similarity of their context.

If the two contexts are very similar, then we should expect that we frequently will see the two words picked from the two Contacts are identical.

Now, as always, we would like to assess whether this approach it would work well. Now, of course, ultimately we have to test the approach it with real data and see if it gives us really semantically related words really give us a paradigmatic relations. But analytically, we can also analyze this formula little bit. So first, as I said, it does make sense right? because this formula will give a higher score if there is more overlap between the two contexts. So that's exactly what we want. But if you analyze the formula more carefully, then you also see there might be some potential problems. And specifically there are two potential problems. First might favor matching one frequently term very well over matching more distinct terms, and that is because in the dot product, if one element has a high value and this element is shared by both context and it contributes a lot to the overall sum.	alright , so that be one possible approach .

And in terms of explaining future data, we might find that it would overfit the training data because of the complexity of the model. The model is so flexible to fit the precisely what the training data looks like, and then it doesn't allow us to generalize the model for using other data. This, however, is not necessary problem for text mining because here we are often only interested in fitting the training documents that we have.

So the inference part. Again, face the local Maxima problem. So essentially they are doing something very similar, but theoretically LDA is more elegant way of looking at the topic modeling problem. So let's see how we can generalize PLSA to LDA or extend the PLSA to have LDA now a full treatment of LDA is beyond the scope of this course and we just don't have time to go in depth in talking about that.

So these word distributions. So here and the other set of parameters are pis and we present as a vector also. And this is for convenience to introduce LDA and we have one vector for each document. And in this case in theta we have one vector for each topic. Now that the difference between LDA and PLSA is that in LDA we're going to not allow them to free the change. Instead, we're going to force them to be drawn from another distribution.	now in this model , all these parameter be free to change and we do not impose any prior , so these word distribution be now represent as theta I vector . so these word distribution . so here and the other set of parameter be pis and we present as a vector also . and this be for convenience to introduce LDA and we have one vector for each document . and in this case in theta we have one vector for each topic . now that the difference between LDA and PLSA be that in LDA we be go to not allow they to free the change . instead , we be go to force they to be draw from another distribution .

Instead we can do draw one from the Dirichlet distribution, and then from this, then we're going to further sample a word and the rest is very similar to the PLSA. The likelihood function now is more complicated for LDA, but there's a close connection between the likelihood function of LDA and PLSA, so I'm going to illustrate the difference here.

So it's very important to understand this. And this gives us the probability of getting a word from a mixture model. Now next in the probability of a document we see there is a PLSA component in the LDA formula. But the LDA formula would add some integral here, and that's to explain to account for the fact that the pis are not fixed, so they are drawn from Dirichlet distribution.	so this be a very important formula as I have stress but multiple time and this be actually the core assumption in all the topic model and you might see other topic model that be extension of LDA or PLSA and they all rely on this . so it be very important to understand this . and this give we the probability of get a word from a mixture model . now next in the probability of a document we see there be a PLSA component in the LDA formula . but the LDA formula would add some integral here , and that be to explain to account for the fact that the pis be not fix , so they be draw from dirichlet distribution .

Now let's next let's talk about parameter is making an inference is now the parameters can be now estimated using exactly the same approach maximum likelihood estimator for LDA. Now you might think about how many parameters are there in LDA versus PLSA. You will see there are fewer parameters in LDA because in this case the only parameters are alphas and betas. So we can use the maximum likelihood estimated to compute that. Of course it's more complicated because the form of likelihood functions more complicated. But what's also important is not set. Now. These parameters that we are interested in, namely the topics and the coverage, are no longer parameters in LDA. In this case we have to use Bayesian inference or posterior inference to compute them based on the parameters Alpha and beta. Unfortunately, this computation is intractable, so we generally have to resort to approximate.	so this be a likelihood function for LDA . now let 's next let 's talk about parameter be make an inference be now the parameter can be now estimate use exactly the same approach maximum likelihood estimator for LDA . now you might think about how many parameter be there in LDA versus PLSA . you will see there be few parameter in LDA because in this case the only parameter be alpha and beta . so we can use the maximum likelihood estimate to compute that . of course it be more complicated because the form of likelihood function more complicated . but what be also important be not set . now . these parameter that we be interested in , namely the topic and the coverage , be no long parameter in LDA . in this case we have to use bayesian inference or posterior inference to compute they base on the parameter Alpha and beta . unfortunately , this computation be intractable , so we generally have to resort to approximate .

Also the effectiveness of a method highly depends on whether the desired clustering bias is captured appropriately, and this can be done either through using the right generative model, the model design, appropriate for clustering, or the right similarity function to explicitly define bias.

And I should also say sometimes we can use application to determine the number of clusters. For example, if you are clustering search results, then obviously you don't want to generate 100 clusters, right? So the number can be dictated by the interface design. In other situations, we might be able to use the fitness of data to assess whether we've got a good number of clusters to explain our data well and to do that, you can vary the number of clusters and watch how well you can fit the data. If it's in general, when you add more components to mixture model, you should fit the data better, because you can always set the probability of using the new component at 0, so you can't in general fit the data worse than before, but as the question is, as you add more components would you be able to significantly improve the fitness of the data and that can be used to determine the right number of clusters. And finally, evaluation of clustering results and can be done both directly and indirectly.	so this be important to keep in mind . and I should also say sometimes we can use application to determine the number of cluster . for example , if you be cluster search result , then obviously you do n't want to generate 100 cluster , right ? so the number can be dictate by the interface design . in other situation , we might be able to use the fitness of datum to assess whether we 've get a good number of cluster to explain our datum well and to do that , you can vary the number of cluster and watch how well you can fit the datum . if it be in general , when you add more component to mixture model , you should fit the datum well , because you can always set the probability of use the new component at 0 , so you ca n't in general fit the datum bad than before , but as the question be , as you add more component would you be able to significantly improve the fitness of the datum and that can be use to determine the right number of cluster . and finally , evaluation of clustering result and can be do both directly and indirectly .

That's the purpose of text mining. So there is a trade off here between doing deeper analysis that might have errors, but would give us direct knowledge that can be extracted from text and doing shallow analysis, which is more robust. But wouldn't they actually give us the necessary deeper representation of knowledge. I should also say that text data are generated by humans An are meant to be consumed by humans so as a result in a text data analysis text mining, humans play a very important role.

So in our case the output from a mixture model or the observation from mixture model is a document not a word. So now we have 1 hidden variable attached to the document. That hidden variable must tell us which distribution has been used to generate the document, so it's going to take two values, one and two to indicate the two topics.	because that be the output from what mixture model . so in our case the output from a mixture model or the observation from mixture model be a document not a word . so now we have 1 hide variable attach to the document . that hidden variable must tell we which distribution have be use to generate the document , so it be go to take two value , one and two to indicate the two topic .

It's to use Bayes rule so it looks like this in order for the first topic is setup, want to generate the document. Two things must happen. First theater subway must have been selected, so it's given by P of 01 second. It must have also been generating the four words in the document, namely two occurrences of text and two occurrences of mining. That's why you see the numerator has the product of the probability of selecting Theta one and the probability of generating the document from Theta 1.	so now how do we infer which distribution have be use to generate the d ? it be to use Bayes rule so it look like this in order for the first topic be setup , want to generate the document . two thing must happen . first theater subway must have be select , so it be give by p of 01 second . it must have also be generate the four word in the document , namely two occurrence of text and two occurrence of mining . that be why you see the numerator have the product of the probability of select Theta one and the probability of generate the document from Theta 1 .

Indeed in this case the document is more likely to be generated from Theta 1,  much more likely than from than Theta 2. So once we have this problem that we can easily compute the probability of Z = 2 given this document, how we're going to use the constraint? Right now it's going to be 1 - 100 / 1,000,000 one.	so the denominator be just the sum of two possibility of generate this document , and you can plug in the numerical value to verify . indeed in this case the document be more likely to be generate from Theta 1 ,    much more likely than from than Theta 2 . so once we have this problem that we can easily compute the probability of z = 2 give this document , how we be go to use the constraint ? right now it be go to be 1 - 100 / 1,000,000 one .

Imagine if a document has many words and it's going to be a very small value here, as it can cause the problem of underflow.	so now it be important to note that in such a computation there be a potential problem of underflow , and that be because if you look at the numerator , the original numerator and denominator it involve the computation of a product of many small probability . imagine if a document have many word and it be go to be a very small value here , as it can cause the problem of underflow .

These probabilities of these words must sum to one. So to summarize, our discussion of generating models for clustering. We showed that a slight variation of Top Model can be used for clustering documents and this also shows the power of generating models in general by changing the generation assumption and changing the model slightly we can achieve different goals and we can capture different patterns in text data.

First it's about rating decomposition. So here what you see are the decomposed ratings for three hotels that have the same overall rating. So if you just look at the overall rating you don't. You can't really tell much difference between these hotels, but by decomposing these ratings into aspect ratings we can see some hotels have higher ratings for some. Dimensions like value, but others might score better in other dimensions like location and so this can reveal detailed opinions at the aspect level.	so now I be go to show you some simple result that you can get by use this kind of generative model . first it be about rating decomposition . so here what you see be the decomposed rating for three hotel that have the same overall rating . so if you just look at the overall rating you do n't . you ca n't really tell much difference between these hotel , but by decompose these rating into aspect rating we can see some hotel have high rating for some . dimension like value , but other might score well in other dimension like location and so this can reveal detailed opinion at the aspect level .

So if you just look at the overall ratings, you don't really get that much information about the difference between the two reviews. But after you decompose the ratings you can see clearly they have high scores on different dimensions. So this shows that the model can reveal differences in. Opinions of different reviewers and such a detailed understanding can help us understand better about reviews and also better about their feedback on the hotel. This is something very interesting because this is in some sense some byproduct in our problem formulation. We did not really have to do this, but the design of the generative model has this component and these are sentiment waits for words in different aspects. And you can see the highly weighted words versus the negatively lower weighted words here for each of the four dimensions. Value, rooms, location and cleanliness. I added the top words, cleared it, makes sense, and the bottom words also makes sense.	the 2nd result be to compare different reviewer on the same hotel so the table show the decompose rating for two reviewer about same hotel again their high level overall rating be the same . so if you just look at the overall rating , you do n't really get that much information about the difference between the two review . but after you decompose the rating you can see clearly they have high score on different dimension . so this show that the model can reveal difference in . opinion of different reviewer and such a detailed understanding can help we understand well about review and also well about their feedback on the hotel . this be something very interesting because this be in some sense some byproduct in our problem formulation . we do not really have to do this , but the design of the generative model have this component and these be sentiment wait for word in different aspect . and you can see the highly weight word versus the negatively low weight word here for each of the four dimension . value , room , location and cleanliness .

Now this kind of laxing is very useful becausw in general a word like long, let's say, may have different the sentiment polarities for different context. So if I say the battery life of this laptop is long, then that's positive. But if I say the rebooting time for the laptop is long, that's bad, right? So even for reviews about the same product laptop, the word long Is ambiguous, it could mean positive or could be negative, but this kind of lexicon that we can learn by using this kind of generative models can show whether a word is positive for a particular aspect, so this is clearly very useful, and in fact such a lexicon can be directly used to tag other reviews about hotels or tag comments about the hotels in social media like tweets. And, what's also interesting that since this is an almost computer and supervised, assuming that the reviews with overall ratings are available, and then this can allow us to learn from potentially a large amount of data on the Internet to reach sentiment lexicon.	so this show that with this apology , we can also learn sentiment information directly from the datum . now this kind of laxing be very useful becausw in general a word like long , let 's say , may have different the sentiment polarity for different context . so if I say the battery life of this laptop be long , then that be positive . but if I say the reboot time for the laptop be long , that be bad , right ? so even for review about the same product laptop , the word long be ambiguous , it could mean positive or could be negative , but this kind of lexicon that we can learn by use this kind of generative model can show whether a word be positive for a particular aspect , so this be clearly very useful , and in fact such a lexicon can be directly use to tag other review about hotel or tag comment about the hotel in social medium like tweet . and , what be also interesting that since this be an almost computer and supervise , assume that the review with overall rating be available , and then this can allow we to learn from potentially a large amount of datum on the internet to reach sentiment lexicon .

So this shows that by using this model we can infer some information that's very hard to obtain, even if you read all the reviews. Even if you read all the reviews, it's very hard to infer such preferences or such emphasis. So this is a case where text mining algorithms can go beyond what humans can do to review interesting patterns in the data, and this of course can be very useful. You can compare different hotels, compare the opinions from different consumer groups in different locations, and of course the model is general. It can be applied to any reviews with overall ratings, so this is very useful technique that can support a lot of text mining applications.	but if you look at the when they do n't like expensive hotel or cheap hotel and you seal it tend to have more weight on the condition of the room cleanliness . so this show that by use this model we can infer some information that be very hard to obtain , even if you read all the review . even if you read all the review , it be very hard to infer such preference or such emphasis . so this be a case where text mining algorithm can go beyond what human can do to review interesting pattern in the datum , and this of course can be very useful . you can compare different hotel , compare the opinion from different consumer group in different location , and of course the model be general . it can be apply to any review with overall rating , so this be very useful technique that can support a lot of text mining application .

So, for example, if a query here that shows 90% of the way it should be on value and 10% on others. So that just means I don't care about other aspects, I just care about getting a cheap hotel. My emphasis is on the value dimension.	so because we can infer the reviewer weight on different dimension , we can allow a user to actually say what do you care about . so , for example , if a query here that show 90 % of the way it should be on value and 10 % on other . so that just mean I do n't care about other aspect , I just care about get a cheap hotel . my emphasis be on the value dimension .

How can we know that we can infer the weights of those reviewers on different aspects? We can find the reviewers whose weights or more precise whose inferred weights or similar to yours and then use those reviews to recommend the hotels for you. And this is what we call a personalized or rather query specific recommendation.	now what we can do be such a query be that we can use reviewer that we believe have a similar preference to recommend the hotel for you . how can we know that we can infer the weight of those reviewer on different aspect ? we can find the reviewer whose weight or more precise whose infer weight or similar to yours and then use those review to recommend the hotel for you . and this be what we call a personalized or rather query specific recommendation .

An you can see the top results generally have much higher price than the low Group, and that's because when reviewers cared more about the value as dictated by this query and they tend to really have favor low price hotels.

Now opinion content, of course, can also vary a lot on the surface. You can identify one sentence opinion or one phrase opinion, but you can also have longer text to express the opinion like a whole article.	it could be about someone else opinion and one person might comment on another person opinion etc . so you can see there be a lot of variation here that will cause the problem to vary a lot . now opinion content , of course , can also vary a lot on the surface . you can identify one sentence opinion or one phrase opinion , but you can also have long text to express the opinion like a whole article .

We can have simple context, like different time or different locations, but there could be also complex text such as some background topic being discussed. So when opinion expressed in the particular discourse context, it has to be interpreted in different ways than when it's expressed in another context, so the context can be very rich to improve the entire discourse context of opinion. From computational perspective, we're most interested in what opinions can be extracted from text data, so it turns out that we can also differentiate distinguish different kinds of opinions in text data from computation perspective. First, the Observer might make a comment about the opinion target in the observed world. So in this case we have the author's opinion. For example, I don't like this phone at all, and that's opinion of this author.	finally , the opinion context can also vary . we can have simple context , like different time or different location , but there could be also complex text such as some background topic be discuss . so when opinion express in the particular discourse context , it have to be interpret in different way than when it be express in another context , so the context can be very rich to improve the entire discourse context of opinion . from computational perspective , we be most interested in what opinion can be extract from text datum , so it turn out that we can also differentiate distinguish different kind of opinion in text datum from computation perspective . first , the Observer might make a comment about the opinion target in the observed world . so in this case we have the author 's opinion . for example , I do n't like this phone at all , and that be opinion of this author .

So for example, I believe he loves the painting and that opinion is really about, is really expressed by another person.	in contrast , the text might also report opinion about other so the person could also make observation about another person opinion and report this opinion . so for example , I believe he love the painting and that opinion be really about , be really express by another person .

Here we can simply use the maximum likelihood estimator, so that's just a standard way of doing things, so all should be familiar to you now, it's just a different model. So after we have estimate the parameters, how can we then allocate clusters to the documents? Let's take a look at this situation more closely, so we just repeated the parameters here. For this mixture model. Now, if you think about what we can get by estimate such a model, we can actually get more information than what we need for doing clustering, right? So see theta. I, for example, represents the content of class I. This is actually a byproduct. It helps summarize what the cluster is about to look at the top terms in this cluster or in this word distribution. And they will tell us what the cluster is about. An P of theta i can be interpreted as. Indicating the size of cluster because it tells us how likely cluster would be used to generate the document. The more likely a cluster is used to generate the document, we can assume the larger the cluster size is.
