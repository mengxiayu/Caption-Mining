the undefined behavior sanitizer is a wonderful tool provided by the llvm project.	behavior sanitizer	14
preprocessing is a copy and paste operation that the compiler performs before actually compiling the program.	preprocessing	0
if the left operand is a pointer and the right operand is an integer type, then only plus or minus may be used and the rules for pointer arithmetic are invoked.	operand	12
a system call is an operation that the kernel carries out.	a system call	0
the first parameter is a format string that includes placeholders for the data to be printed.	parameter	10
the buffering semantics of printf is a little complicated.	printf	27
a c-string is a series of bytes delimited by a nul character which is equal to the byte 0x00.	string	4
in low-level terms, a struct is a piece of contiguous memory, nothing more.	a struct	20
a void pointer is a pointer without a type.	pointer	7
the following is a rapid fire section.	the following	0

the heap is a contiguous, expanding region of memory.	the heap	8
process forking is a powerful and dangerous tool.	process forking	0
the following is a snippet of how to use system.	the following	0
this also means that system is a blocking call.	system	21
however, this detail is an unwanted complexity.	this detail	9
the survey makes sure to note that memory allocation is a moving target.	memory allocation	35
our heap memory is a list of blocks where each block is either allocated or unallocated.	heap memory	4
allocating memory is a worst-case linear time operation – search linked lists for a sufficiently large free block.	memory	11
the slub allocator is a slab allocator that serves different needs for the linux kernel slub.	the slub allocator	0
the slub allocator is a segregated list allocator with minimal splitting and coalescing.	the slub allocator	0
almost weirdly, a thread is a process, meaning that creating a thread is similar to fork, except there is no copying meaning no copy on write.	a thread	16
calling pthread_exit in the main thread is a common way for simple programs to ensure that all threads finish.	thread	9
but when compiled with -o2, assembly output is a single instruction.	assembly output	28
a critical section is a section of code that can only be executed by one thread at a time if the program is to function correctly.	section	11
if the memory location is only accessible by one thread, for example the automatic variable i below, then there is no possibility of a race condition and no critical section associated with i. however, the sum variable is a global variable and accessed by two threads.	the sum variable	202
a mutex is a simple data structure.	a mutex	0
atomic compare and exchange is an instruction supported by most modern architectures (on x86 it’s lock cmpxchg).	exchange	19
a mutex is a semaphore that always waits before it posts.	a mutex	0
while push (and pop) is executing, the data structure is an inconsistent state, for example the count may not have been written to, so it may still contain the original value.	the data structure	35
the other is the loop is a busy loop.	the loop	13
a ring buffer is a simple, usually fixed-sized, storage mechanism where contiguous memory is treated as if it is circular, and two index counters keep track of the current beginning and end of the queue.	a ring buffer	0
the following code is an incorrect implementation.	code	14
the following code is an incorrect implementation.	code	14
the dining philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem.	the dining philosophers problem	0
a page is a block of virtual memory.	a page	0
a page table is a map from a number to a particular frame.	a page table	0
each table is a list of pointers that point to the next level of tables, som sub-tables may be omitted.	each table	0
mmap is an interesting call because instead of tying each virtual address to a physical frame, it ties it to something else.	mmap	0
mmap is a trick of virtual memory of instead of mapping a page to a frame, that frame can be backed by a file on disk, or the frame can be shared among processes.	mmap	0
one of the big optimizations is a file may be lazily allocated to memory.	optimizations	15
sharing anonymous memory is an efficient form of inter-process communication because there is no copying, system call, or disk-access overhead - the two processes share the same physical frame of main memory.	memory	18
for files less than the size of a long, using fseek and ftell is a simple way to accomplish this.	ftell	56
hadoop is a great example where processes will write to append-only tables and then other processes will read from those tables.	hadoop	0
one advantage of fcfs is that scheduling algorithm is simple the ready queue is a fifo (first in first out) queue.	fcfs	17
a kilobyte is one thousand bytes, a megabyte is a thousand kilobytes and so on.	a megabyte	34
as for another definition, a protocol is a set of specifications put forward by the internet engineering task force that govern how implementers of a protocol have their program or circuit behave under specific circumstances.	a protocol	27
tcp or transport control protocol is a connection-based protocol that is built on top of ipv4 and ipv6 and therefore can be described as “tcp/ip” or “tcp over ip”.	transport control protocol	7
sockets are created with a domain af_inet for ipv4 or af_inet6 for ipv6, socket_type is whether to use udp, tcp, or other some other socket type, the protocol is an optional choice of protocol configuration for our examples this we can leave this as 0 for default.	the protocol	146
void send_request(host_info *info) { int sock_fd = socket(af_inet, sock_stream, 0); // re-use address is a little overkill here because we are making a // listen only server and we don’t expect spoofed requests.	address	94
google protocol buffers is an open-source efficient binary protocol that places a strong emphasis on high throughput with low cpu overhead and minimal memory copying.	protocol buffers	7
the last piece of background is an important one.	background	18
a filesystem is an implementation of the file interface.	a filesystem	0
a single indirect block is a block that stores pointers to more data blocks.	block	18
forgetting to release resources is a common c programming bug because there is no support in the c language to ensure resources are always released with all code paths.	resources	22
the integrity of the file system assumes the directory structure is an acyclic tree that is reachable from the root directory.	the directory structure	41
the iso9660 filesystem is a read-only filesystem originally designed for optical storage media (i.e. cdroms).	the iso9660 filesystem	0
a signal disposition is a per-process attribute that determines how a signal is handled after it is delivered.	disposition	9
for example, the following is a program that slowly prints a dot every second, up to 59 dots.	the following	13
the mask is a temporary signal mask used during the signal handler execution.	the mask	0
spectre is a bug where instructions that otherwise wouldn’t be executed are speculatively executed due to out-of-order instruction execution.	spectre	0
the following snippet is a high-level proof of concept.	snippet	14
openbsd is an arguably better system for security.	openbsd	0
a container is a lightweight environment that shares resources and a kernel with a host machine, while isolating itself from other containers or processes on the host.	a container	0
a terminal is an application that displays the output from the shell.	a terminal	0
the other type is a dynamic library.	type	10
the sentence that sets the expectation is the following the result of function calls involving any one handle (the "active handle") is defined elsewhere in this volume of posix.1-2008, but if two or more handles are used, and any one of them is a stream, the application shall ensure that their actions are coordinated as described below.	the expectation	23
openmp is a standard that is an alternative to pthreads.	openmp	0
storemi is a hardware microcontroller that analyzes how the operating system accesses files and moves files/blocks around to speed up the load time.	storemi	0
although it may seem that the header is a constant size, you can include optional parameters to augment the path that is taken or other instructions.	the header	26
kqueue is a system call that is exclusive the bsds and macos.	kqueue	0
each arena is a large region of memory that is internally allocated by the system (using brk(2) or mmap(2)), and managed with its own mutexes.	each arena	0
someone who knows sleepsort is a bad idea but still dreams of an excuse to use it.	sleepsort	18
privacy concerns aside, and believe me there are a lot of them, the big problem was that this rootkit is a backdoor for everyone’s systems if programmed incorrectly.	this rootkit	89
a rootkit is a piece of code usually installed kernel-side that keeps track of almost anything that a user does.	a rootkit	0
