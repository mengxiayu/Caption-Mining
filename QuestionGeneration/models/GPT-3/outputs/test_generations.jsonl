To do this, the allocator keeps track of the sizes of free blocks of memory. When allocating memory for a new process, the allocator searches the free list for the smallest block that is large enough to hold the new process. If the smallest block is larger than the amount of memory needed for the new process, then the block is split, and the remainder is added back to the free list. The allocator then allocates the required amount of memory to the new process from the beginning of the newly split block.The main advantage of Best Fit is that it minimizes internal fragmentation, which can lead to better memory utilization. However, the main disadvantage is that it can be time-consuming to search the free list for the smallest block of memory that is large enough to hold the new process.The time complexity of Best Fit depends on the size of the free list and the number of processes that need to be allocated memory.

Trying to overcome this problem by storing inodes in some other location greatly increases the complexity of the filesystem.
