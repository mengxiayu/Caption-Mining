The author also attempts to colour code the time series, however the results of this approach were not positive. On the other hand, [5] use CNNs in a bank telemarketing case study, whereby the aim is to predict whether a customer will take up a particular marketing campaign based on a number of numeric and nominal features per customer. The results for this study yield an impressive 76.70% accuracy, which yields the highest accuracy amongst 7 classifiers. In order to incorporate external features in the forecasting model, [6] use a deep convolutional neural network to model short and long term influences of events of stock price movements.

       "\"Food Recommender Systems. A common approach for food recommender systems is to recommend a recipe based on its ingredients. In [8], for example, the authors developed a system that relies on recipes that people like to infer their preferred ingredients. The system then recommends new recipes containing the previously inferred ingredients. In [9], the authors developed a system that collects users' preferences by asking them to rate and tag the recipes they usually cook at home. The system then relies on user's preferences to rank recipes and deliver recommendations with the highest scores. This Matrix Factorization algorithm outperformed the content-based approach proposed by [8]. Other approaches only rely on dietary information to recommend recipes that would match users' needs. YumMe, the recommender system developed in [36], automatically extracts dietary information from pictures of recipes to form a user profile. The system then relies on this user profile to deliver subsequent recommendations. In [11], authors analyzed people's eating behavior and clustered people in two categories: those interested in getting healthy recipes, and those who did not care about that. They found that two of the main recipe rating predictors for the first group were the fat and calorific content of the recipe, and decided to incorporate these features in their recommendation process.All these works focus on improving recommendation algorithms. They do not investigate how the modality of the interaction between the system and its users can improve users' experience which, according to [15], should not be neglected.\""
