In both contexts, Ai aims to imitate, combine, and extend existing artistic styles, and can transform creative practices. In our ongoing research, we investigate such Creative-Ai from sustainability and ethical perspectives. The two main focus areas are understanding the environmental sustainability aspects (material, practices) in the context of artistic processes that involve Creative-Ai, and ethical issues related to who gets to be involved in the creation process (power, authorship, ownership). This paper provides an outline of our ongoing research in these two directions. We will present our interdisciplinary approach, which combines interviews, workshops, online ethnography, and energy measurements, to address our research questions: How is Creative-Ai currently used by artist communities, and which future applications do artists imagine? When Ai is applied to creating art, how might it impact the economy and environment? And, how can answers to these questions guide requirements for intellectual property regimes for Creative-Ai?", "sections": [{"heading": "I. INTRODUCTION", "text": "Recent development in artificial intelligence extends the possibilities for digital art industries beyond reproduction and distribution: Ai 1 facilitates the commodification of automated creation of arts that aims at imitating, combining, and extending existing artistic styles (Creative-Ai), with a potential to transform the creative practices. This has major implications for artistic practice and society in general. We focus on studying these implications through questions, such as: how is creative-Ai currently used by creative communities, and what can guide the ethical practices for the design and use Creative-Ai? We study these questions through mixed-methods research that combines ethnography, digital methods, sustainability assessment, and recent human-computer interaction approaches (such as design fiction, diary studies, RtD-approaches to develop design tool-kits and heuristics for value-sensitive design) with a critical method. These studies will, then, motivate new approaches for the development of alternative directions for environmentally sustainable Creative-Ai, in which our research outcomes are expected to form ethical guidelines, theoretical knowledge, and material prototypes. We see these research directions fitting with the discussions of this workshop, as our research directly contributes to the ethics and sustainability discussions within the Generative Ai research community.\nIn this workshop application, we outline our ongoing research in the context of our recently initiated project, and raise questions that we are currently exploring and would like to bring into the workshop discussions. The two main focus areas of our current works-in-progress are 1) environmental sustainability (material, practices) in the context of Ai arts and 2) ethical issues related to who is involved in the creation process (power, authorship, ownership). These two areas represent the core subjects of two individual PhD projects, respectively, and they are represented by the two PhD students co-authoring this paper.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "II. ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY PERSPECTIVES ON CREATIVE-AI: MATERIAL, PRACTICES", "text": "Our main research directions related to environmental sustainability are to analyze the environmental impact of various Creative-Ai technologies and practices, and to use the outcome of the analysis to inform the design and use of Creative-Ai technologies. The environmental impact of Ai technologies without the contextualization of creative processes has been discussed by previous research [1]- [5], with energy use and CO 2 emissions being analyzed by [2]- [5]. Strubell et al. [2] have proposed energy and policy considerations for deep learning in general and Natural Language Processing (NLP) in particular. Others [3], [4] have instead focused on the impact of Ai on carbon emissions, for instance by estimating the carbon impact of different Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) [3]. However, none of the prior sustainability research specifically focuses on the use of Ai tools by the creative industries, nor on the context of art produced using Ai as a tool. Referring to the latter as Ai art, we have argued in a recently submitted paper that the environmental footprint of Ai art needs to be studied to understand the environmental impact of the related artistic practices. Creative work processes are likely to differ from other Ai application areas, and the context of use should be understood so that we can develop approaches for more sustainable and ethical design and use of these Creative-Ai technologies.", "n_publication_ref": 8, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "A. Environmental impact of the current Creative-Ai practices", "text": "We conducted an online study aiming to understand how various creative practitioners use Creative-Ai in their practices. Our study revealed that some of the artists use massive datasets for training the Ai. For instance, [6] was using 45 terabytes of data -587,763 image files, 1,880 video files, 1,483 metadata files, and 17,773 audio files equivalent of 40,000 hours of audio. Other artists collaborate with embodied Ai [7] in creation of the artworks. Regarding such human-Ai interaction within the Ai artistic practice, we should keep in mind that Ai materials are not necessarily static materials. Therefore, we have to not only account for the practice and agency of the artist, but potentially have to consider the agency of the Ai technology. This emerging interaction between these two agents necessitates a sustainability assessment that takes into account both material and process. Our insights gained so far imply that Ai materials are often used in the ideation, actualization and display phases of a creative process, following the process model proposed by [8]. In the ideation phase, several artists seem to use Ai generators for inspiration and for helping ideas to emerge. In later stages like actualization, Ai is used by many artists to create the artwork itself. The Ai technologies can also be entangled with the display of the artwork: some artists are generating interactive artworks in real-time together with the audience or environments.", "n_publication_ref": 3, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "B. Understanding the environmental impact of Creative-Ai technologies", "text": "We have measured energy usage in different kinds of running environments for VQGAN+Clip [9], [10], as a popular generative art tool applied by many practitioners, and provided initial figures for these measurements in our paper that is currently under peer review. We are also currently expanding our mapping of the energy consumption on different kinds of devices and other algorithms/tools used by the creative communities (for example Google Magenta). These insights can help us to understand what ways of using the Creative-Ai technologies have high or low environmental impacts, and informs us how to design these technologies in the future. It will also inform the design of guidelines and toolkits for Creative-Ai practitioners.", "n_publication_ref": 2, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "C. Design implications on system architecture", "text": "One example of sustainability informed design is the design of latent spaces that serve the needs of the creative practitioners, but have minimal energy impact in terms of computation. We initiated a collaboration with another research group to explore the latent spaces of GAN algorithms for sound synthesis [11]. We expect that the results of this study will help us not to only understand the energy consumption and environmental impact of the AI algorithm development process, but will also shed light on the fidelity and accuracy required from these technologies in artistic practices. To the best of our knowledge, there is no prior research that combines sustainability assessment with the development of Ai technology for artistic purposes, and that conducts this development in close interaction with artists. We hope to be able to arrive a better understanding of the needs and demands by artists by conducting the described project.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "D.

Potential directions for future explorations are how to facilitate more sustainable ways of working with Ai in creative communities. Our question in this context is if a system can guide the users in terms of energy consumption, provide information of the energy consumption of their creative process, and potentially influence the creative process to reduce energy consumption. In either case, these design studies need to be rooted in the needs of the creative practitioners and artists, which is why in the beginning phases of the research we focus particularly on understanding these current practices and engaging in collaboration and discussions with creative practitioners to develop understanding of their needs.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "E. Emerging Ai art ecosystem", "text": "Sustainability issues are also related to the commercialization of Ai art. These include, for example, the use of emerging technologies such as blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and Nonfungible tokens (NFTs). An increasing number of Ai artists are exploring innovative high-tech pathways for selling their artworks -which in their turn will have environmental impacts. New initiatives emerge such as a \"fair trade\" art certificate that is offered to artists who use NFT's and cryptocurrencies for their works. These certificates indicate that a work of art has been produced in a socially sustainable manner, but currently there are no environmental sustainability certificates for Ai art. These initiatives and technologies are constituent factors as Ai art markets emerge. Since the value of art is cocreated in society, the participating members determine what is considered valuable and appreciated, and in turn is in the focus of consumption. Ai art(s) shape new markets, which have the potential to introduce an additional environmental footprint through energy-heavy blockchain, cryptocurrencies, and NFT technologies. We have pointed this out in our latest study, and we intend to conduct further studies on environmental sustainability of Ai art markets based on such technologies. III. SOCIAL SUSTAINABILITY CONSIDERATIONS OF CREATIVE-AI: POWER, AUTHORSHIP, OWNERSHIP Issues of power, control and ownership are entangled with Creative-Ai in several ways. In the midst of increasingly large networks of actors involved in the process of designing, implementing, training and maintaining the systems, the entire concept of authorship is becoming rather a collective than individual phenomenon. As some Ai systems gradually become more independent, the distinction between human and non-human as a creative agent starts to blur, which makes the situation more complicated both legally and ethically.", "n_publication_ref": 0, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "A. Conjuction of law and ethics with creative Ai", "text": "Collective and fluid definitions of authorship are in stark contrast with the legal framework of exclusive intellectual property rights. The outputs of the Creative-Ai system may under most copyright regimes be protected if and only if the human fingerprint of individual human author(s) in the resulting work can be identified, and the threshold criteria of originality is satisfied [12]. For many, if not the majority of Ai-created works, it is an open question whether such criteria of legal protection can be fulfilled [13].\nEqually critical aspect is the data used as training material to shape an Ai model. Data mining legislation with regard to copyrighted works is relatively relaxed in the US, in certain Asian countries, and to a somewhat lesser extent in the EU. Yet, irrespective of the question whether or not the data used in the training was copyright-protected or in the public domain and therefore technically free for anyone to use, the data use itself can have serious neocolonialist implications for the creative communities that have contributed to this cultural corpus [14]. Furthermore, such communities may be in more precarious positions than the system developers, with little or no voice to raise against unwarranted and potentially culturally insensitive uses of their works [15]. This illustrates the need for a sincere conversation of ethical issues related to the use of data in Creative-Ai. For this end, we are currently preparing a series of interviews and interactive workshops with Nordic Ai artists, exploring their encounters with these complex issues and their visions of what forms the future of ethically sustainable creative Ai could take. These observations of artistic processes will also provide empirical ground to inform the shaping of ethical guidelines for the field.", "n_publication_ref": 4, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "B. Shortcomings of current ethics guidelines for Ai", "text": "In the past decade, there has been a surge in the development of ethical frameworks that seek to identify central ethical themes relevant for general Ai use and development [16]. As of the latest update in April 2020, AI Ethics Guidelines Global Inventory alone lists 173 guidelines or principles developed by various governmental entities, NGOs or private companies [17]. One prominent example is the Guidelines for Trustworthy AI by European Commission's independent High-Level Expert Group on AI [18].\nAs noted by several authors ( [19], [20]) and the AI HLEG themselves [21], the problem with these original frameworks was that they approach ethics from such a high conceptual level that they are unpractical for the creative professionals. As a solution to this problem, there is a growing need of applied ethics tools that would be more readily approachable in the development pipeline and more accessible for users with limited prior knowledge of ethics. There have been some attempts to address this need by translating the abstract ethics framework principles into a series of questions or discussion prompts. Some of the established approaches include the Open Data Institute's Data Ethics Canvas [22] and the Ethical Toolkit for Engineering/Design Practice [23], both of which take the approach of posing the development team an extended set of questions to elicit or expose issues of ethical relevance. More recent suggestions, such as the Data Ethics Decision Aid (DEDA) [24], the Ethical Matrix [25] and the ECCOLA Ai ethics card game [26] distance themselves from what could be criticised as check-box ethics and aim instead towards more interactive analysis processes that encourage dialogue among participants. This could take the form of an elaborate workshop of exploring the ethics themes relevant for the project at hand, possibly facilitated by the tool providers as a paid service.", "n_publication_ref": 10, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "C. Prototypes for ethics-informed stakeholder analysis", "text": "To address these issues from a pragmatic perspective, we are currently developing applied approaches that aim to help designers and developers explore the ethical and societal implications of their work with the focus specifically on the people directly and indirectly impacted. This is in line with the patiency-led ethics approach [27]. The focus of such work will be on tools or processes that are easily accessible both in terms of (free) platforms and structurally so that the team may also carry out the analysis without an external facilitator.\nThe first prototype of such an approach was tested at the International Society for Music Information Retrieval Conference in 2021. Our ethics-informed stakeholder analysis starts with a collective brainstorming of various stakeholders that could be relevant for the scenario at hand on the Mentimeter platform 2 . The participants then individually evaluate the identified stakeholders against one another on the axes of power and authorship, respectively. Combining these two planes of information, the stakeholders are mapped on a 2x2 matrix such that disparities of the power distribution between the stakeholder groups becomes more apparent. Finally, this matrix is used as a basis for discussing concrete action points that can be taken to alleviate the effects of power imbalances and make the design processes more diversely inclusive. This process will be further developed and tested in workshops planned for the early spring 2022. Some of the aspects under scrutiny include the axes of the analysis matrix and the question of how the specific ethics perspectives may be best integrated into the process. For example, the concept of 'authorship', which seemed to cause some confusion among the initial participants, could be replaced with the axis of 'interest', as used in the more traditional stakeholder analysis, which will change the nature of the task to a certain degree. Furthermore, in the next prototypes, the ethics perspectives will be more closely integrated into the analysis through the use of a limited number of focused question prompts that aim to widen the participants' brainstorming on who might be impacted by the development and use of creative Ai systems.", "n_publication_ref": 1, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "IV. SUMMARY", "text": "Here, we have covered the directions of our on-going research within the domains of environmentally and socially sustainable Creative-Ai. For environmental sustainability these have included case studies on the process of Creative-Ai practices, quantifying the energy impact of the technologies used by creative practitioners, potential user-centered design implications for the system architecture and the user experience, and studies of the emerging Creative-Ai and Ai Arts ecosystems. For social sustainability, our research directions focus on the need to better understand the particularities of the artistic creation processes with Ai, as well as the practically motivated issue of stakeholder analysis. This way, we hope to close a gap between existing ethical frameworks and their actual implementation within creative communities and Creative-Ai developers.\nThese research directions are of immediate relevance in the context of generative Ai, and with this workshop application we wish to participate in discussions and knowledge-exchange with researchers who work with generative Ai in various application contexts.

Cookie walls and paywalls, used to retrieve consent, recently generated interest from EU DPAs and seemed to have grown in popularity. However, they have been overlooked by scholars. We present in this paper 1) the results of an exploratory study conducted on 2800 Central European websites to measure the presence and practices of cookie paywalls, and 2) a framing of their lawfulness amidst the variety of legal decisions and guidelines.\u2022 Security and privacy \u2192 Economics of security and privacy; \u2022 Information systems \u2192 Online advertising.", "sections": [{"heading": "INTRODUCTION", "text": "Most websites offer their content for free, though this gratuity often comes with a counterpart: the personal data of users is collected to finance these websites services by resorting, mostly, to tracking and thus targeted advertising. Websites may use cookie walls, also known as tracking walls or \"take it or leave it choices\" [13,23] which condition the website access to the user's acceptance of certain trackers on her device (computer or smartphone) [33], whereas data subjects are more likely to consent if given such take-it-orleave options, even if they do not want to provide their personal data in exchange for visiting a website [23]. Websites also developed paywalls to enforce their subscription business models: a user who refuses to accept tracking is then obliged to provide a sum of money to access that website [6]. A paywall thus consists of \"various strategies that restrict content access until the user pay for them, possibly after allowing them to view some content for free\" [31].\nPaywalls have been questioned from a legal point of view by several non-academic stakeholders [29] [6] because consent to the processing of personal data must be given freely and unconditionally (Art. 7(4) GDPR), and consent is not \"freely given\" if users cannot refuse tracking without adverse consequences, e.g., by paying a subscription. European Data Protection Authorities (DPAs) [6,8] recently consider paywalls legitimate, though there is some inconsistency in the positions taken on whether a paywall is legally compliant with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) [16] and with the ePrivacy Directive (ePD) [15].\nPaywalls generally offer the possibility to give access to the content of the website without tracking, against payment or an account subscription, i.e. a paid tracking-free option. But the option of paying the subscription model is not actually free of charge or tracking-free because users might pay with their data, even though they initially paid for an ad-free and tracking-free version of the website. Papadopoulos et al. [31] report that users who pay for a subscription do not usually get a tracking-free version of the website since after purchasing a subscription, they face as much advertising and tracking-related resources as possible.\nSimply put, paywalls present several novel problems and their cross analysis with cookie walls, coined cookie paywalls (an illustration of which can be found in Figure 1 in the Appendix), has not been analyzed yet. To address this research gap, we investigated the following research questions: (1) What are the different types of paywalls and cookie walls, and how do they articulate with each other? (2) What is the scale of these practices? (3) Are these practices lawful? Pursuant to these questions, we conducted an interdisciplinary and empirical study on the top of 150 websites in Central Europe which resulted in the following contributions: (1) a fine grained classification of paywalls: hard, soft, metered paywall, registration wall, cookie paywalls, and cookie wall, (2) a legal analysis of both cookie walls and paywalls, (3) a quantitative measurement of these practices: 61 of the 2800 websites studied use paywalls (2.72%), and 13 cookie paywalls (0.66%); (4) most cookie paywalls consist of news websites, (5) they do not track visitors prior to interaction, and (6) their prices are within average for newspaper subscription.", "n_publication_ref": 14, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "BACKGROUND AND RELATED WORK", "text": "Legal requirements for online tracking. To comply with the GDPR and the ePD, websites must obtain consent from EU users when tracking their behavior (Art. 5(3) ePD) for concrete purposes (such as targeting advertising). Some other purposes are exempted of consent, e.g, functional or essential trackers (Recital 66 ePD). The only way to assess with certainty whether consent is required is to analyse the purpose of each tracer on a given website [19,39,40]. A valid consent must comply with several requirements: prior, freely given, specific, informed, unambiguous, readable, accessible, and revocable (Art. 4(11) and 7 GDPR) [33]. Most relevant to this paper are the requirements of prior and freely given consent. Prior consent. Before storing or reading the trackers on a user's terminal, websites need to ask consent to users (Article 6(1) GDPR). Freely given consent. The request for consent should imply a voluntary choice of the user to accept or decline some or all trackers, taken in the absence of any kind of pressure on the user to persuade her to give consent [38,41,42]. Making the provision of website service or access thereto conditional on the acceptance of certain non-essential trackers can affect, in certain cases, the freedom of choice [6], and subsequently, the validity of consent [42].\nPaywalls and cookie walls. Few scholars studied paywalls mostly from a business or a digital media point of view [5,18,28], though the work of Papadopoulos et al. [30] is relevant to our paper since it is the first study investigating the privacy impact of paywalls. They classify paywalls into two categories: i) hard paywalls \"require paid subscription before a user can access content\", and ii) soft or metered paywalls \"limit the number of articles a viewer can read before requiring a paid subscription\". This latter category is used indistinguishably. They found that 7,6% of websites world-wide used paywalls in 2019, and that most of them are news websites. Another finding is that subscribing to a paying offer does not significantly reduce tracking. Santos et al. [33] commented in 2020 that most stakeholders and regulators consider that a cookie wall violates a freely given consent. Outside of the academic scholarship, the Austrian NGO NOYB filed complaints against paywalls of seven major German and Austrian news websites in 2021 [29] considering that consent is not freely given if the alternative to being tracked is to \"pay 100 times the market price of the user's personal data\".\nConsent management. Matte et al. [27] measured the compliance of IAB Europe's Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) is the main framework used by several actors on the web to manage consent. They found that out of 28 257 crawled websites, 1426 implemented the TCF, and further found consent may be stored prior to the user's consent, or against their will. We build upon prior work and further address (1) the state of current paywall types, (2) the usage by the most visited websites from different countries, (3) the amount of money requested, and (4) how current positions from regulators shape paywall practices.", "n_publication_ref": 16, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "METHODOLOGY", "text": "Target Countries. We examined top websites of 13 countries that are categorised by [24] as a part of \"Central Europe\": Austria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Germany, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Poland, Slovakia, Slovenia, and Switzerland, a highly interesting target region for our study: (1) they are in the same geographical region, though they show diversity in their language, culture, and economic situation, (2) the countries include former USSR republics, former eastern bloc countries, former western bloc countries, and neutral countries, as well as EU and non-EU countries, (3) these countries have various DPA positioning regarding cookie paywalls (in favor for Austria, critical for Germany, without official statement for some others). We aimed to investigate whether DPA positions is correlated with paywall practices.\nData collection. A list was constituted using Tranco [32] and includes the top 1000 Austrian websites and the top 150 websites of each of the 12 other Central European countries (for a total of 2800) between 27th March and 25th April 2022. The reason for conducting a more representative analysis of Austrian websites relied on the fact that the Austrian DPA is the only one ruling in favour of paywall implementation [8] (see Table 2). We aimed to study whether such a decision impacted the rate or type of paywalls used in Austrian websites. For statistical reasons, the results restricted to the top 150 Austrian websites are presented distinctively (in parenthesis).\nAnnotation and analysis. Websites were inspected by three female students annotators which are native German speakers, and fluent in English. All non-German or non-English websites were translated using deepl.com. The annotation occurred between 19th May and 31th May 2022. The annotators used Firefox 102.0.1 (64-bit) on the OS Microsoft Windows, free of add-ons and with Standard privacy settings unchanged after installation. The following aspects were annotated: i) whether the website has a cookie wall or paywall, ii) paywall type, iii) website category, and iv) general notes (price /type of subscription, position of the wall on the screen). We initially based our paywall classification on [30] (explained in Section 2), but novel types of paywalls were identified (see Section 4.) The analysis of websites consisted in two rounds of annotations. The results were inscribed in a spreadsheet for each country. In rare cases of disagreements between the annotators, the annotators discussed the case verbally in online-calls until they reached a mutual agreement. The data was then merged into a single spreadsheet to allow the drawing of comparative analysis.\nTracking assessment of cookie paywalls. Since paywalls are claimed to propose an alternative to tracking, we analysed whether or not the websites implementing them were tracking their visitors before a user expresses their decision regarding payment by money (one-time or standing payment) or with their data (giving consent to tracking). A fourth annotator with technical knowledge first visited the annotated websites listed as cookie paywalls in the first round using Firefox 102 on Ubuntu 20.04 in incognito mode, with only the plugin Disconnect in monitoring and no-blocking mode. We recorded the cookies immediately after loading the page and without any previous user consent, and noted the number of trackers spotted by Disconnect. In a second step, the annotator consented to all personal data collection and processing, refreshed the web-page and recorded the cookies and the number of trackers.\nAnalysis of cookie walls and paywalls. The legal analysis is based on the GDPR and the ePD. We consulted the guidelines of both the European Data Protection Board ((EDPB -an EU advisory board on data protection) and the guidelines and decisions of DPAs, in particular, the very recent positions from 2022 of the French [6], Austrian [8] and Italian DPAs [22].  [43], in their EU commissioned study on the Proposal for the ePrivacy Regulation, mentioned a non-exhaustive blacklist of circumstances in which cookie walls are banned: i) tracking on websites, apps and or locations that reveal information about special categories of data, ii) tracking by unidentified third parties for unspecified purposes, iii) tracking by all government funded services, iv) invalid consent (e.g. unequal balance of power) v) consent asked for processing for multiple purposes. The Austrian DPA [8] stated that, in principle, it is permissible to ask payment for access to a website as an alternative to consent to tracking. It reiterates his position from 2018 [1] wherein it indicated that paywalls give a degree of choice: i) accept tracking while accessing a website; ii) refuse tracking with limited access to a website; or iii) pay subscription fees without tracking.\nThe French DPA [6] states that the lawfulness of cookie walls and paywalls must be assessed on a case-by-case basis, depending on a set of five evaluation criteria: Alternative to tracking. When users refuse consent to tracking purposes, websites need to show there is a \"real and fair\" alternative way (by other websites) allowing access to the content, without consenting to data collection. Possible imbalances need to be considered, for example if the website: i) has exclusivity on the content/service offered; ii) is a dominant or essential service provider. Reasonable price of a paywall. Paywalls are not prohibited, in principle, since it constitutes an alternative to consent to tracking. The paywall price must be reasonable. The threshold of the reasonable rate depends on a case-by-case analysis. Account requirements. The creation of an account must pursue specific and transparent purposes for users (e.g., a subscription must be accessible on different terminals). Paywalls is limited to fair remuneration. Paywall are limited to the purposes which allow fair remuneration for the service offered. If a publisher considers that the remuneration for its service depends on the income it could obtain from targeted advertising, only consent for this purpose should be necessary to access the service (refusing consent to, e.g., personalization of editorial content should not then prevent access to the content of the site). Paywalls cannot impose acceptance of all trackers in a website. Websites may request the user's consent on a case-by-case basis to deposit trackers when the latter is required to access content hosted on a third-party website.\nLawfulness. From the analysis of Table 2, we observe the following: i) several stakeholders present divergent positions regarding", "n_publication_ref": 12, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "Stakeholders", "text": "Positioning on cookie walls and paywalls EDPB [10,11], EDPS [12], BEUC [3], Dutch [9], German [20], Danish [7], Belgian [2] DPAs Cookie walls violate a freely given consent; access to services and functionalities must not be made conditional on the user consent to non-necessary tracking purposes Italian [22], Spanish [35] DPAS Cookie walls are not valid.

GDPR must be balanced against other rights, including freedom of expression and to conduct a business. Austrian DPA [8] Paywalls consist of a valid consent cookie walls and paywalls, which hamper the desired level playing field between websites in the EU, as well as legal uncertainty; ii) regulators tend to accept paywalls, according to a case by case analysis and evaluation criteria, (e.g. price that is \"reasonable\", or \"fair remuneration\"). Such casuistic analysis blocks efforts for automated auditing from DPAs and other organizations and researchers to check compliance of website paywalls; iii) the concept of equivalent service offer needs criteria to assure a balanced offer; iv) paywalls are dependent on the fact that users are informed of alternative services, though several user studies report that users do not read or understand the content of consent banners [4,25]; v) fundamental criteria regarding (a) the type of data that can be processed, (b) the retention period of such data, (c) limits on the purposes, (d) types of data subjects that might be affected (like children) are absent in any of these guidelines; vi) news sites might fall in the category of sites revealing information about special categories of data (Article 9(1) GDPR), since reading about certain topics could reveal one's political opinion or health status [37]. Also, information about people's media use and reading habits is generally sensitive [43]; vii) the future ePrivacy Regulation proposal [17] (in Recitals 20aaaa and 21aa of the Council's version) already includes the concept of an \"equivalent offer\" to consent to tracking purposes and thus acknowledges the possibility of paywalls. It prohibits walls by public authorities, and service providers in a dominant position, alongside with the French DPA standpoint.", "n_publication_ref": 18, "n_figure_ref": 0}, {"heading": "The results of the empirical study", "text": "Classification. Though we initially based our classification on the one developed presented in [30], it does not accurately represent the current state of paywalls because i) it does not differentiate soft and metered paywalls, ii) cookie walls and registration walls are absent of their classification despite their presence on the web, iii) different communities refer to the same practices by different terms. Hence, our classification follows: Hard paywall requires a one-time or a standing payment with money (i.e. subscription or enrolment) before any online content can be accessed (as defined by [31]). Soft paywall presents the beginning of the content to generate interest, but the full content is restricted to payment. Metered paywall provides users with a certain contingent of articles free of charge that is time bounded. Registration wall provides users with only one option of creating an account on the website (otherwise users will have denied access). Cookie wall denies users access if they do not consent to all trackers present on that website, regardless of payment. Cookie paywall provides users with two choices: either 1) consent to tracking, and 2) payment/subscription (by money) to use the website tracking-free.\nPrevalence of paywall categories. The analysis was conducted on 2800 websites (see Data collection in Section 3): a) 61 of which contained a paywall (2.72% of the analyzed websites), b) 13 contain a cookie paywall (0.66%), wherein 6 thereof had a hard paywall, and c) 7 embed a cookie paywall combined with a soft paywall. The results are summarized in Table 1. The percentage of paywalls is approximately three times lower than the percentage found by [30], which may indicate a decrease in popularity of this practice: paywalls are not a streamlined practice. However, this finding must be taken with a pinch of salt, notably because 1) the dataset is limited in terms of scope and size since it only comprises the 150 top websites of central European countries which may bias the general results; but also because 2) we observed that it is complex to measure the extent and the scale of this practice with this methodology: manual measurement is intrinsically unpredictable. Indeed, a second analysis lead to different results. This second round was conducted using Firefox 102 and Chrome 103 (Chromium flavored) on Ubuntu 20.04 in incognito mode. We observed discrepancies in real-time between the two browsers, and a general inconsistency of the results according to various parameters, such as the type of browser, the OS, and the IP address. For instance, on the 26th of July, for the same user using the same machine (OS and IP are therefore identical), the website https://dennikn.sk/ presents at the same time a cookie wall on Chrome and a soft paywall on Firefox (see Figure 2 in the Appendix). We draw two conclusions from these findings: i) the extent of these practices is intrinsically hard to measure, especially with a manual analysis; ii) web users are presented with different interfaces according to criteria unknown to them. An automatic and cross-validated large scale analysis may address this issue: an analysis performed by multiple crawlers (automatic) using different settings (cross-validation), to assess how each parameter may influence the presentation to end-users. 1 However, even if some reverse engineering may partially explain their working, the lack of transparency from these systems can be seen as deceptive to users. A large scale analysis can be combined with an automated tracking detection.\nTypes of websites using paywalls. A large majority of paywalls, and more specifically cookie paywalls, were found on news media websites which corroborates [31]'s findings. One of the arguments in favor of this finding (e.g., in case of the Austrian DPA) is that traditional newspapers and magazines used to sell their printed products to their customers (readers) and this can justify the adoption of paywalls. 2 Due to the fact that almost only news and magazine websites used a wall, we had decided to further divide this category into: i) daily newspaper, ii) weekly newspaper, iii) weekly magazine, iv) news magazine, v) news portal. The subject-specific magazines that have a cookie wall or paywall in their websites were assigned to the corresponding magazine category, for example, to the category \"technology magazine\". Daily newspapers and news portals use paywalls the most -namely a total of 31 daily newspapers and 14 news portals respectively. In third place are weekly magazines wherein only four weekly magazines with paywalls were found.\nPrevalence of TCF framework. Our analysis confirms the prevalence of the TCF framework (introduced in Section 2). Websites using the TCF typically place a cookie named euconsent-v2 on the user's device once consent has been obtained, and sometimes beforehand. The content of this cookie can be decoded at http://iabtcf.com/#/decode, and yields the purposes and vendors for which consent has been obtained (if any). We found out that 11 out of 13 cookie paywalls are using it.\nNo tracking prior to user consent. The same tracking assessment indicates compliance with the TCF framework: before any action (besides loading the page), no tracker has been stored (one has been found but on one website which does not use the TCF). Websites using the TCF systematically create a euconsent-v2 cookie (characteristic of the use of the TCF) after consent is given to all tracking purposes. A large scale analysis may lead to different results (see Matte et al. [27]).\nPrices of paywalls. All websites presenting cookie paywalls are subscription-based whereby a subscription buys an unlimited access to all content of the website for one user. Subscriptions are mostly offered per month (9 websites out of 13), but some propose a per-week subscription. We observe prices ranging from 2,99\u20ac to 6,25\u20ac per month (after normalization based on the price per year), which amounts to 36 to 75\u20ac per year. These prices are reasonable compared to the average subscription to a newspaper (the average monthly price for an online newspaper is 14.06\u20ac [34]). Table 3 in the Appendix presents the subscription prices of cookie paywalls normalized per month and per year.\nRegistration wall. Only one website (www.nzz.ch) was found that only requires registration (without payment) in order to see the full text of any article.", "n_publication_ref": 6, "n_figure_ref": 1}, {"heading": "CONCLUSION AND FUTURE WORK", "text": "Cookie paywalls require more attention from both academia and the legislator: the former to provide more substantial technical and legal analyses, and the latter to level the playing field (see [14]) towards protective and viable business models across the EU, in line with the current practices and their fast evolution. Technically, large scale analyses and automated tracking detection would shed light on these opaque practices. Legally, case-by-case studies, potentially supported by a technical analysis, would facilitate informed decisions by regulators. Finally, future work includes user-centered studies answering questions such as: (1) Do users actually pay for subscriptions? (2) Which reasons motivate a possible payment? Generally speaking, are cookie paywalls yet another variation of a dark pattern used to nudge users [21]?   Figure 2 illustrates that for the same user using the same machine (OS and IP are therefore identical), the website https://dennikn.sk/ presents at the same time a cookie wall on Chrome and a soft paywall on Firefox: we observed discrepancies in real-time between two browsers according to various parameters such as the type of browser, the OS, and the IP address.
